Today, @theclaremartin looks at La Luz frontwoman Shana Cleveland's new solo record, 'Night of the Worm Moon,' which is full of "lullabies dropped from a passing U.F.O." https://t.co/dFxKAO7kgM https://t.co/Pfs6FAADhfI see #TrumpLiedPeopleDied is trending - it's good people are calling Trump out on his horrible response to the pandemic.

Can we add a #BidenLiedPeopleWillDie since the Biden campaign urged people to vote during yesterday's primaries?
https://t.co/nho7uinr5S@cenkuygur @DrBiden American citizens want real, USEFUL policies, not political theater where politicians say pretty words &amp; pretend to care yet then do nothing or even make the situation worse.

Biden doesn't care about healing any of us, he's against universal healthcare--&gt;

Trump has said and done any number of things that would have crippled any other leader. Yet his ~40% base is unwavering.

https://t.co/JZg57R7CKI@Xavelrie @GhostAnneBoleyn No one would have to deal with "pre-existing conditions" issues if Dems had enacted universal healthcare.
