"Progressives" need to come up with a new name. 

Currently, it's an embarrassment to be associated with the "Progressive Left." 

#M4A #M4ALL #SinglePayerHealthcarePfizer announced its covid vaccine as a "breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis." 

Now it is among those leading the charge to maximize its profits, even at the expense of people dying for lack of affordable access to the vaccine. https://t.co/kSut3k8NObThe “security state” not only failed to keep us safe, but worsened the coronavirus pandemic and unleashed violence on the people hardest hit. https://t.co/1klDNXWmqL@radertron @TheDORIANGRAE "The GOP has seized con­trol of the courts, engaged in sys­tem­at­ic vot­er sup­pres­sion &amp; cre­at­ed large-scale pro­pa­gan­da net­works, as Dems wave the rule book &amp; won­der why no ref­er­ee has stepped in to tell every­1 that they are, in fact, right."
