Just five. https://t.co/Lqf1xHadS3This talking point is remarkably resilient, even as private labs and hospitals produce tests faster and more reliably than the CDC, Italy's system is on the brink of collapse, and Britain's NHS was virtually overwhelmed by just under 200 cases. https://t.co/9PYkULwMMa https://t.co/U8YgwdwByqResidents of New York City and the surrounding suburbs are now an unwanted presence in much of the country.

#COVID #2020Election #CookPoliticalReport #Podcasts #Cancelculture https://t.co/6DazEIwVMHThere can be no doubt that lockdown orders are reserved for only the least favored constituencies.
