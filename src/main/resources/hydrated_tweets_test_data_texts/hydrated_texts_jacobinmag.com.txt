https://t.co/iBpGugKJmG"The number of Americans impacted by food insecurity is now projected to hit fifty-four million — up from thirty-five million pre-pandemic. More than fourteen million American households are at risk of eviction and more than 336,000 Americans have died."

https://t.co/jFgSnzeO4QMillions can’t pay rent because of the coronavirus-induced recession. In the absence of government help, many are going on rent strike. We talked to two rent strikers about why they organized their building to withhold rent and how others can do the same. https://t.co/MUI2k0g3wlMany states are racing to reopen their economies, even though the daily number of new coronavirus cases is holding steady nationally. Without a comprehensive nationwide plan, if workers go back to their jobs now, we will see more cases — and more deaths. https://t.co/gCDimU1NpxBy recruiting notorious neoliberal economist Larry Summers to advise him on coronavirus policy, Joe Biden has shown that since 2008, liberal elites have learned nothing and forgotten everything. https://t.co/aLKdyRyxXBHollywood has been anticipating a pandemic for a long time in films like "Contagion" and "Outbreak." But what our popular culture has had more difficulty in imagining are the ways in which structural inequality would play out in a global health crisis. https://t.co/i1seJ1mjPHAs the death toll and unemployment claims continue to soar, it’s all too clear that the United States has failed the test on almost every front. Progress in battling coronavirus will continue to be hamstrung by our dysfunctional federalist system. https://t.co/V3KwZGWgeuMeet the Coronavirus Profiteers https://t.co/kQxomUGb75The 1980s saw the spread of a nationwide panic about “stranger danger,” a supposed epidemic of child kidnappings and murders. Under the guise of protecting children, the media-driven hysteria played a key role in the development of mass incarceration. https://t.co/alW79cpsmVWell, it finally happened! Today a well-meaning acquaintance suggested I didn’t have a good understanding of JobKeeper flaws, but promised to send me a good explainer article to aid in my learning.

He sent me my own article. I wrote it. 

https://t.co/SMKBWx2andSince the 2003 war against Iraq, a massive 70 percent of the country’s health care infrastructure has been destroyed. As hospitals are besieged by victims of the COVID-19 pandemic, a state enfeebled by two decades of conflict is again at a breaking point. https://t.co/oasDSnKRZVIn my opinion the most promising thing happening electorally anywhere in the entire country is this: six socialist candidates running on a DSA slate together in New York City, aiming for Albany and DC https://t.co/AbPjXTPl5JHospitals in Japan have complained of overcrowding, understaffing, and lack of protective equipment. They were turning away sick people as they struggled to cope with surging numbers of coronavirus infections and a collapsing emergency medical system. https://t.co/NXDicE7LUNIt is critical - to save lives - we must organize and fight for workers’ safety and hazardous pay. #COVID19 #ProtectAllWorkers
https://t.co/Hi22yBYEAvAcross the Global South, the coronavirus crisis has highlighted how IMF “structural adjustment” policies have undermined public health care. But the devastation wrought by the shutdown also owes to a longer-term ill: an exploitative global trade regime. https://t.co/6QcnR0yHfbThe US’s Coronavirus Relief Measures Are Nowhere Near Enough

https://t.co/lrJhsdXP5gNow, in a new interview with @jacobinmag's @alexdoherty7, Mirowski lays out a sharp-eyed and alarming analysis of how neoliberalism is capitalising on the pandemic crisis and making ready to finalize its dominance over the human race and our planet.

2/Should we blame working-class black people for lashing out at a government and economy designed to repress, exploit, and subdue them; during a pandemic in which capitalism has made it near impossible for them to survive? No. https://t.co/7SE4iWVEdNFaced with the current crisis, we spoke with "Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste" author Philip Mirowski about the neoliberals’ responses to the pandemic, the successes they think they’ve achieved already, and the dangers in store for the Left. https://t.co/Ndx38D3pxGOne consequence of COVID-19 is that you no longer hear Democratic politicians talking much about how working people should be free to choose their insurance options and “if you like your insurance, you can keep it.” https://t.co/KYZSAknjAkNow that a real-life pandemic has arrived, it has exposed what has been consistently disavowed by the Hollywood imagination in films like "Contagion" and "Outbreak": a fundamental divide between rich and poor, both within the US and over the world. https://t.co/i1seJ1mjPHIn the Red Summer of 1919, racist violence hit America as the Spanish flu ravaged the country. With mass protests against police murders sweeping the pandemic-plagued United States, it appears we might be now living in a Red Spring. https://t.co/X6MhPfSFNhUSA: As nursing-home deaths spike during the COVID-19 crisis, hospital and nursing-home companies are pushing for state laws that would shield their executives and owners from responsibility — and trying to convince lawmakers by spending serious cash: https://t.co/pB3ol6TjMDLegendary radical scholar Frances Fox Piven on organizing the unemployed under coronavirus, where the Bernie Sanders movement goes from here, and why breaking rules and disrupting business as usual are central to making social change. https://t.co/vabQj1y2NBImportant piece from @ColinGordon6: 

Meatpacking is not an invariably low-wage, heavily exploited occupation, and the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging packinghouses was not inevitable.

They're both the result of the assault on unions and workplace democracy

https://t.co/klxuPBPHktVersions of today’s global pandemic nightmare have been imagined by Hollywood since the 1990s. But films like "Contagion" and "Outbreak" have overlooked the way a health crisis is unevenly distributed across classes, both in the US and around the world. https://t.co/SiS8XX1WAGBefore the pandemic, we were already in the middle of a mental health crisis. Now it’s even worse. We need a Medicare for All system not just to treat our medical needs, but our mental ones, too. https://t.co/g1ry6SBYmfConcerns about the spread of coronavirus are legitimate, but the right to public protest must be upheld through the crisis. Unfortunately, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has done the opposite, eroding our rights to assembly during the pandemic. https://t.co/zNedRZOkfQWhile meat processing has always been toxic and dangerous work, cramped quarters designed to maximize line speeds, unsanitary conditions, and limited access to soap and water have created the ideal setting for outbreaks of COVID-19. https://t.co/EYoeebVH21
