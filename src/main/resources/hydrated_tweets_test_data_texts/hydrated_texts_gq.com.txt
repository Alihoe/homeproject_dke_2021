What if I told you these attacks were happening on U.S. soil, including children hit in Philadelphia and a White House staffer walking her dog in the DC suburbs. https://t.co/2yXtfc0dsODeeply disturbing story from @juliaioffe. 'In each case, individuals believed to be FSB were in range of the CIA officers.. In 2 incidents, location data showed FSB agents in the same hotel at the same time their targets experienced the onset of symptoms.' https://t.co/5ixKrZNI1kFirst, it was American diplomats in Havana. Now the attacks on Americans have happened in China, Poland, Georgia, Taiwan, Australia, the UK—and even inside the U.S. New evidence links the attacks to the FSB, but the CIA won't take the information to Trump.
https://t.co/2yXtfchOkmMust-read reporting by @juliaioffe. As reprehensible as it is to carry out out sonic/microwave attacks in denied areas like China, Russia, &amp; Cuba, the fact that (likely) the FSB felt OK doing so in Australia, Taiwan, and *the US* is a crossed Rubicon. 

https://t.co/mXpEZrys1hOne former CIA official quipped that “a good day for Gina [Haspel] is when we don’t talk about Russia.” 

Sources say she warns that if the CIA pushes Trump too hard on Russia, he will replace her with someone like Senator Tom Cotton.

https://t.co/2yXtfc0dsODetailed story by @juliaioffe that says the Cuba &amp; China attacks are more widespread — and likely caused by Russia. CIA officer @Mpolymer was hit in Moscow. Others in CIA were hit in Georgia, Poland, Australia &amp; Taiwan. CIA found FSB officers were nearby. https://t.co/7hHMJV8Nil@icecube @TMZ @JoeBiden @Blklivesmatter @KingJames @Meka_luvs_music @StephenCurry30 @CP3 @DwyaneWade @BarackObama @TiffanyDCross @DrJasonJohnson @rolandsmartin @azdemparty @CaptMarkKelly @kyrstensinema @youngdems @NCDemParty @NC_Governor @GKButterfield @TeamJoe @RevDrBarber @TheRevAl @MichaelRWear @NotOurFaith @MSNBC @CNNPolitics @PeteSouza @AOC @BernieSanders @theestallion @SenKamalaHarris @KamauMandela @StacyBrownMedia @RepBarbaraLee @ProChoiceCaucus @llcoolj @drboycewatkins1 @scottwoodssays @trymainelee @Diddy @NickCannon @spidadmitchell @CJMcCollum @tobias31 @ProjectLincoln @MichaelSteele #TrumpChinaBankAccount #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpFamilyCorruption

https://t.co/GhGJ0mTs5sWhat you likely remember as "sonic attacks" on American diplomats in Havana are actually the result of directed energy weapons that cause permanent brain damage—and are now happening on U.S. soil. 

Oh, and the CIA is scared to tell Trump about it.

https://t.co/2yXtfc0dsO"Doctors Tell Me I Have COVID. Why Won't the Tests?" https://t.co/CitttY7yz4 --@juliaioffe@DavidRHumphrey @TuckerCarlson Oh yeah.. because I’m sure Trump children stopped making money once Donald became a president...right.
