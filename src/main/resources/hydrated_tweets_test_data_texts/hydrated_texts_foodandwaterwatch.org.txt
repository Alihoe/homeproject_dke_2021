As Congress debates another round of much-needed COVID relief, Big Oil and Gas should NOT be getting a bailout! https://t.co/pzj4nAazZU@cnnbrk so why are you not covering the fact Gavin Newsom approved several racking permits in California during lock down when we were preoccupied with Covid? Oh and you guessed it he has lobbying ties to the companies approved to Frack. https://t.co/ik17ufHVJYWhile the world focuses on the Coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration has been busy doubling down on its campaign to deregulate Big Ag. 

This is dangerous, especially when outbreaks have been increasing at meatpacking plants. https://t.co/FW4RMkscuXFood and Water Watch never sit on the fence.

https://t.co/nagVCuSDh8@blueheartedly Americans are being held hostage by Trump and GOP. Our elections, healthcare,  welfare, Bills in the Senate are being held hostage.
America doesn't negotiate with hostage takers. Why should The Trump Administration and GOP be exceptions? #AmericanHostages 
https://t.co/IMs4sEYWBCMeat packing Businesses who “reduced regulations” because of the pandemic put workers and our food supply at risk. #theview https://t.co/JWFIJ7a3rJ#COVID19 cases are rising &amp; Trump's @CDCgov refuses to ensure everyone has access to water. Responding to a letter urging a national shutoff moratorium, they suggested that ppl without water "use hand sanitizer." We demand better! @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris https://t.co/A1JIqZubxu#WorldWaterDay is on March 22 and cities across the country have reversed water shutoffs to ensure everyone can wash their hands. 

#WaterIsAHumanRight, and we shouldn’t have to wait for apandemic to provide universal services. Here’s our WATER Act plan:   https://t.co/rqMNQ0e79fDespite a local moratorium on water shutoffs, Detroit residents are still going without water.

500+ faith leaders call for national shutoff moratorium in next coronavirus relief bill. #NoShutoffs https://t.co/xZUvcZAGFG“Trump’s plan to instruct slaughter plants to stay open despite causing major outbreaks of COVID-19 is even worse than his suggestion to use disinfectant to treat sick people. It’s deadly and foolish and will cause catastrophic harm." 

https://t.co/1Y74wXtQ8zThis morning, my feed was a steady stream of personal COVID tragedies - illness and death.  My heart breaks for all of us having to endure this nightmare. In the meantime, GOP is holding the relief bill to protect Corporations.

https://t.co/Zi8aErlL5vTrump’s USDA has made up a loophole in loan guarantee rules to create a sneaking way to give millions in taxpayer dollars to corporate factory farms.

Oh but rural communities impacted by coronavirus will not be able to use the same rule to receive aid.
