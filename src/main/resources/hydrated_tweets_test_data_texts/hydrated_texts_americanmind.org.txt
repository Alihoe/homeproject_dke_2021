Honestly, this essay is a MUST READ for anyone who wants the what/when/how/why of what is happening today.

https://t.co/FCJLGcHmtaRead the full text of my speech today titled “American Industrial Policy and the Rise of China” here: https://t.co/bTgTYREbwL"Political control of education by people without much skin in the game and without their own kids in public schools could allow interference with schooling to become more radical and even less restrained."

America has become a joke.

China is laughing.
https://t.co/KtE3g0bNGL@EricRWeinstein Good diagnosis!

"The American system of the 2020s through the city, county, state, and up to the federal level has been staffed with people who know how to speak and make themselves appear blameless, but not how to act."

Wiley at The American Mind / @ClaremontInst https://t.co/P3m63H76cjFinally, C.R. Wiley concludes that because of the #coronavirus, America may be on the cusp of something that would have seemed impossible 20 years ago: a hybrid economy of diffused production, bringing together productive households and global markets... https://t.co/LKk1PviipM“As @realDonaldTrump has become a wartime president, the enemy he is fighting is the CCP. Long before this crisis, the CCP was waging political/economic war against the U.S. The #WuhanVirus is merely another weapon in this war.” - @BritravKennedy https://t.co/5CULLUvOi0China is not our friend but our foe. Right now, Communist China is happy to have the United States on lockdown as long as possible. Every day that goes by our economy tanks &amp; millions of Americans sit at home, unemployed &amp; worried about their future https://t.co/hbZt9Yjytf"The U.S. government must have two goals—limiting the deaths caused by the COVID-19 virus while limiting the economic damage to firms and individuals caused by the prosecution of this necessary war." https://t.co/2FLWNP5T26"Given the problems in the Chinese economy that arose as a result of the ongoing trade war with the United States and Donald Trump, the CCP and Xi Jinping appear to have made the calculation that a crisis caused by the #coronavirus would be preferable." https://t.co/5CULLUvOi0President Trump has taken decisive steps to stop the Wuhan virus. In doing so, he is a wartime president. The enemy is the Chinese Communist Party who has been waging political and economic war against the US. The virus is another weapon in this war https://t.co/hbZt9YjytfLong before this crisis, the CCP was waging political and economic war against the United States. The Wuhan virus is merely another weapon in this war. https://t.co/lKkIjdlfvCTime to treat this pandemic like an alien invasion https://t.co/2FLWNP5T26It is an incredible stroke of luck that we happen to have a president who is not interested in surrendering to the virus or “managing our decline.” https://t.co/d4eUqWD4WC https://t.co/xeKEcOyscjOne of the challenges #COVID19 has exposed in America is complacency. Management is killing us. The virus demands we break free. @MarkLutter explains why we must burst the complacency bubble—before it’s too late. https://t.co/c6L3crx5aJA recent piece at @theammind by @CarlosRoa92 on “the constitutional personality“ and Coronavirus:

https://t.co/utRX4xyJSBReminder: China has exploited our attempts to integrate it into the global order with some success, managing to co-opt and capture international institutions like the World Health Organization. https://t.co/d1Ip9SKbjv.@realDonaldTrump is not bound by calcified ideological frameworks. Contrary to his critics, he has been proven right about borders, China, trade/globalism. It’s time to lead America past the pandemic &amp; political paralysis into a new century of greatness. https://t.co/FZk3ThLXml“Contrary to his flailing critics, the president &lt;@realDonaldTrump&gt; has been proven right about borders, China, trade, &amp; globalism. He is the only one who now can—and...will...lead America into a new century of greatness.” @ClaremontInst https://t.co/PdzJWFzdCL"Without putting too fine a point on it, China seems to have taken the position that if they were to suffer the coronavirus, so too was the United States and the rest of the world." 

-@BritravKennedy https://t.co/5CULLUvOi0“China believes that its rightful place is at the center of the world and views the last 100 years as an aberration it intends to correct.” - @marcorubio #ThrowbackThursday https://t.co/xLbD8vkqz3The past year has seen America’s industrial and consumer supply chains threatened by two critical events: the rise of Huawei as a Chinese state-backed telecoms giant, and the outbreak of the coronavirus (also originating in China). https://t.co/NSv0RcNsYP“Do we really want to replace a president highly antagonistic to China with Biden, a lifetime grifter fully owned and operated by handlers in Beijing? - @KeenanPeachy  https://t.co/ZmZdwEc0D9Look to a #HomesteadAct for Post-COVID Life. @JarrettStepman explains “Our New Frontier.” https://t.co/vFPrfVVMqH“In response to the #coronavirus, states have gone far beyond their constitutional remit, directly violating multiple provisions of the Constitution. The federal government has not only the authority, but the obligation to act.” - Kevin Portteus. https://t.co/bYOMsK5QpqI was learning about nuclear contamination safety because I figured it covered both that disaster, and also the more likely scenario of mass contagion.

My latest for The American Mind: The Chinese Art of War https://t.co/5o6FL62N5A“As thought experiments go, it is not far-fetched to consider the Wuhan Virus an attack against the United States. It is an elementary position of Chinese statecraft not to engage an enemy directly.” - @BritravKennedy https://t.co/CSTi6F1vpBWhy China wants US economy locked down https://t.co/aIxcU1jgIsI appeared on Claremont Institute's podcast to discuss NY Times' historically false 1619 Project.

As we discussed, the goal of the 1619 Project is nothing less than the alienation of Americans from their country’s true philosophical and political founding in 1776. https://t.co/WlUxCZIRIB https://t.co/f7SH7y0nsZ“Does coronavirus vindicate the importance of scientific expertise and its institutions?

But in the Left’s new civil war, I am praying for the liberals against the woke mob totalitarians. https://t.co/Vr7hMQOerwProject to integrate Communist China into world order has been arguably US globalist elite's most disastrous. 

@joebiden cheered it on at every turn.

@realDonaldTrump's taken it to China like no president before him.

This is what's on the ballot in 2020 https://t.co/OgrSilUbnLCoronavirus is not a victory for authoritarianism, or a defeat for democracy. Rather, it's a cautionary tale about what happens when you combine libertarianism with DIRECT democracy—a combo we have been slouching toward for decades. My latest in @theammind
https://t.co/VGEKnLd6cL.@josh_hammer wrote this just today. He's way more credible on this. I'm more or less an outsider. Yet if I can figure this sort of thing out, then you know something's afoot.

1) China is the most important foreign policy issue of our time, and it's on the ballot https://t.co/OgrSilUbnL

2) @JoeBiden epitomizes the disaster of the pol establishment on this issue, and has yet to be questioned on it https://t.co/Q5sFlbEXs7The radical left-wing mob is coming for the American way of life. 

The party has capitulated to the far left and Joe Biden is beholden to it. He is being prepped to come for your jobs, your cars, your children’s textbooks and your houses of worship.

https://t.co/65nbxMYO13Your daily reminder that:

1) @JoeBiden was in Washington for more than 40 yrs where he cheered on China's rise--and his son seemingly profited from it 

2) @realDonaldTrump has done more than any president since Nixon opened the relationship to fight back https://t.co/OgrSilUbnLThis essay by @aaronsibarium might be the single best thing I've read so far on why the U.S. response to the pandemic has been so lackluster

It's also a reminder that Aaron is one of the most exciting young American writers working today: https://t.co/7ddtGHpczhThe chaos in our streets is designed to appear like good old-fashioned class warfare. But is it? 
 
No.
 
This isn’t a proletarian revolution. This is a generational fight within our ruling elite class.
 
More from my op-ed at @theammind: https://t.co/5ENgVbRe0RHere, like abroad, COVID-19 has only intensified the general mistrust of globalism. People and institutions around the world are facing up to this reality. For many, the old world order can’t die soon enough.

https://t.co/P5UhVzo7uUIn this article for @theammind, I explored the importance of Wuhan to China and global trade.

It is the central node of the Yangtze River's logistics network.

A failure of the ports here means zero ocean container traffic upriver from the delta.

https://t.co/3UqiY7I5TJ

18/One of our best political thinkers, Angelo Codevilla, ties the COVID-19 hysteria to larger and darker political trends at work.  It's all about political power and the abuse of it.

It ain’t pretty for the American people https://t.co/OgrSilUbnL17/ Voluntary masking is everyone’s right, but the CCP loves government and corporate mask mandates because they turn every individual into a walking billboard of fear and submission to previously-unconstitutional measures and lockdowns.

What would a fully re-empowered ruling class that had tasted the possibility of dis-empowerment do to preclude anything like that from ever happening again? https://t.co/GZshh8wP00Trump understands this.
