https://t.co/c5D1XbRH6VUsing https://t.co/blcmTFDJoo 0.26 IFR implies 325K fatalities. 325K's the best case assuming a vaccine is achieved. If not, about 500K is realistic.

https://t.co/v4Qq04t03O"As Anthony Fauci himself said in an interview during the 2009 swine flu epidemic, 'You can’t isolate yourself from the rest of the world for the whole flu season, but use some good judgment.' Now we know why." -- @RMConservative 

https://t.co/tIoRAnEtfVThe lockdown has flattened nothing but society, liberty, and livelihoods. https://t.co/lLSnR9GMFC@morethanmySLE Here’s your CDC guidance....corona no deadlier than the flu. Carry on......
https://t.co/BbyS7J0shb"For the first time, the CDC has attempted to offer a real estimate of the overall death rate for COVID-19, and under its most likely scenario, the number is 0.26%." https://t.co/jFWyE2Way8Folks, its not just that we destroyed our country for nothing by not focusing on where 90% of the deaths are. We killed so many more people by not putting all those resources to where they should have been sent rather than having everyone wear a mask! https://t.co/HkKjGgD715as Anthony Fauci himself said in an interview during the 2009 swine flu epidemic, “You can’t isolate yourself from the rest of the world for the whole flu season, but use some good judgment.” Now we know why. https://t.co/Hvv84Z41j6With criminals now taking advantage of the mandate to wear masks. Police in Santa Ana, California, say robberies in the city have risen by 50%. https://t.co/K9SNmG5tm5Actually, the mayor is correct in asserting that he “can’t stress how dangerous this is for our young people.” COVID-19 is not dangerous at all for school-age children https://t.co/YfLZ8F8ee2Corona deaths are being assigned under the most absurd conditions. What is the extent of Corona Death inflation? #WeThePeople #ReopenAmerica https://t.co/6ZFXnEw2FuLot's of compelling information on inflating number of #covid19 deaths in nursing homes, and I didnt even mention the incentive of Medicare reimbursement https://t.co/4g4Hxu6tTqAnother interesting observation  from @RMConservative.

What percent of cases of COVID19 are asymptomatic? 

How much less likely is an asymptomatic person (than a symptomatic person) to spread the virus?

Has any government agency provided these numbers?

https://t.co/fF37zCVrAKWhat does the cure being worse than the disease look like?  THIS https://t.co/Hvv84Z41j6 #endthelockdownThe ACLU is right – #coronavirus spreads like wildfire in prisons and ICE facilities. But that ship has sailed a long time ago.

https://t.co/eoE381SfhOCDC estimates  the death rate from COVID for those under 50 is 1 in 6,725 overall, but again, almost all those who die have specific comorbidities or underlying conditions.
