I know from personal experience that women who want to terminate an unwanted pregnancy will do whatever it takes, legal or not. As they have been since the dawn of time.The Charlotte Lozier Institute, research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, has listed the Moderna vaccine, which has been shown to be 95% effective in preventing Covid-19, among the ethically uncontroversial CoV-19 vaccine programs https://t.co/wheX5jWOqhHelp!! Share modern science with  “researchers” so attached to abortion and determined to remain in the dark ages.  
 
More than 60 potential treatments for #coronavirus are currently working… none requires fetal tissue from aborted babies.

https://t.co/dANTfJOJ0pAccording to the Lozier Institute:  The Regeneron therapy given to President Trump was made in Velocimmune HUMANIZED MICE, a novel platform that uses genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cells to generate antibodies. https://t.co/dmg4XTgAc3@MrCasey62 This is the most comprehensive list of vaccines with associated usage of fetal cell lines. I am glad my country is purchasing the Pfizer ones, which do not use those lines in production.

@LozierInstitute provides an in-depth ethics assessment of the COVID-19 vaccine programs currently in progress. https://t.co/vIEfj3Nt1zPfizer's vaccine is among the ethically uncontroversial according to the @LozierInstitute who as analyzed them from a pro-life moral perspective. https://t.co/2SNarrrqAr https://t.co/KifSTqSVHM
