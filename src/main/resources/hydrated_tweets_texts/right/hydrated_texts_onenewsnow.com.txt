15 years ago Dr Fauci says “HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine."

Fauci knew about HCQ in 2005 -- nobody needed to die https://t.co/jbzIDQgnjAWe've been saying this for quite some time. 

The big question is, have you reconciled this in your mind?

If HCQ can be used as both a prophylactic AND a therapeutic, then why do we need a vaccine or an expensive alternative in Remdesivir?
