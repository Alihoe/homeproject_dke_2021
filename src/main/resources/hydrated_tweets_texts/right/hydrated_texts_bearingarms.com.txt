While gun sales have soared, violent crime has dropped. 
 
 guns,  crime.
https://t.co/xyXCWRKGw2The laws are already out there and fully capable of stopping mass shootings and we’ve had several mass shooters who should have been stopped beforehand but people just dismissed the future killers as real threats for whatever reason.

It’s clear he and other gun control advocates do see a path to victory as far as their gun control agenda is concerned, even if it doesn’t happen with Beto in the White House. https://t.co/KfPMGxXkCENevada Gun Control Law Causing Huge Headaches For Prosecutors

…you should at least be afforded the protections of the 8th Amendment before your 2nd Amendment rights are stripped from you.

https://t.co/VcBVL6mek2What happens when a Republican backs gun control? Much of the time, they find themselves facing a primary challenge, something an incumbent would really rather not have to endure. That’s what’s happening to Scott now.

https://t.co/sNLKTiII9rIf you want to stop the flow of guns to Mexico, lock down the illicit travel across the border. Shut down the trafficking of drugs from there and you’ll shut down the flow of guns to there. It’s not rocket science.

via @BearingArmsCom  https://t.co/rzEWvJ1cOqThe truth is, gun control doesn’t work.

The times when it appears to be are an artifact of other policies and situations that also take hold, though anti-gunners ardently refuse to acknowledge that fact.

Truth doesn’t care if you acknowledge it or not.
