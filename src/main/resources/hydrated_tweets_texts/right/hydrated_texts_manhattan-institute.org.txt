We may have to spend vast sums to make our urban world safe again today. Billions on preemptive vaccines and ventilators and virology research could save trillions lost in future lockdowns. https://t.co/Rq6hAPkK0yNew York City’s wealthiest neighborhoods lost between a third and half their population since the pandemic hit. The city’s budget is overwhelmingly dependent on the 5% of New York’s wealthiest who left the city, and the danger is that many will stay away. https://t.co/s4YSGvOSwvOver the decade, the #coronavirus recession is projected to add nearly $8 trillion to the national debt—pushing the debt held by the public to $41 trillion within a decade, or 128% of GDP. This would exceed the national debt at the height of World War II. https://t.co/tWqXpOYNx9 https://t.co/gGbrpoXjIAAt the start of the pandemic, some warned that the homeless were at high risk from #COVID19. But while some shelters have seen serious outbreaks, worst-case scenarios have not come to pass—with infections remaining low among the unsheltered. https://t.co/2iAdDI2BjvGiven the #COVID19 recession, New York City’s $8.7 billion plan to build four borough jails will potentially overwhelm the capital budget. Before committing billions to a flawed plan, the city should consider an alternative: rebuilding #RikersIsland. https://t.co/g8KqdpaA7B Oct 16: @ManhattanInst hosts: Practical Wisdom In A Time Of COVID And Beyond https://t.co/jbiMQVIBuY with our Tony Mills, @jennfrey of @UofSC, @jmjpickford of @HCMStrat, and MI's @smarickAt the start of the pandemic, some warned that the homeless were at high risk from #COVID19.

The typical high-earning New Yorker pays as much in income tax as 196 median-earning New Yorkers combined. https://t.co/s4YSGvxh7VTens of millions of workers have jobs because people enjoy interacting with others. If the risk of contagion remains for decades, then human contact will bring fear more than joy and those jobs will disappear. The result will be an employment Armageddon. https://t.co/Rq6hAPCkS6To restore New York City's finances in the wake of the #coronavirus-induced recession, layoffs may be unavoidable. With the specter of layoffs looming, pay freezes and a new early retirement program are ways to avoid trimming staff rolls. https://t.co/M4BVApURqb via @eric_koberThe benefits of the progressive programs proposed by 2020 candidates—from #MedicareForAll to student debt forgiveness and "free" college—would flow predominantly to the professional class—upper-middle-class, highly educated households. https://t.co/5InyXOvm1B #Issues2020Vaping appears to help people quit smoking, and New York’s hasty action may wind up doing more harm than good. https://t.co/wJdGtpZ4bFStudies show the risk of infection from #coronavirus plummets outdoors. New York City should allow restaurants and retailers to expand onto sidewalks and into streets—and give businesses a shot at survival. https://t.co/tnLtBYCDdQ via @michael_hendrixHappening now: @SenatorTimScott talks with @JamesRCopland about prospects of criminal justice and police reform in the next Congress.

Obama walked into the greatest economic mess since the great depression - BTW, left behind by another GOP POTUS and the puppet inherited a recovering economy - which he hasn't F'd up - yet.

https://t.co/wrpiVuArR7@NewsbySmiley @MiamiHerald @JoeBiden platform is so far to the left, I am in disbelief these business owners are supporting @JoeBiden, unless you start looking at Joe’s proposed Trillions for Healthcare, infrastructure etc..which will benefit, enrich, these supporters. https://t.co/mA4q3zvEnJThis upper-income focus is no accident.  SALT cap repeal, free college, &amp; student loan forgiveness would provide  $1.5 trillion for wealthier families, versus $272 billion for lower-income families. Even M4A would mainly benefit the upper-middle class. https://t.co/CBgZkRwBg8Even if we get a vaccine tomorrow, many commuters have found that they like staying home.

https://t.co/vnEoUTqqGkFor high schoolers in rural environments, Idaho's Advanced Opportunities program has leveled the playing field. Even before #COVID19, the program leveraged virtual learning to provide advanced coursework to students who may not otherwise have had access. https://t.co/QDhuUDrqgVWith any luck, the #coronavirus will be a fading memory by summer. But by then, massive damage will already have been done to state and regional economies. https://t.co/DKQJQ8Rj4e via @EjmEjHouseholds, businesses and municipal governments can’t survive a pandemic. These three groups owe $35.3 trillion in debt. Without federal assistance, we face mass-scale debt defaults—as people stop paying their credit cards, auto loans and mortgages. https://t.co/MlCsXmsNoDIn the wake of #COVID19, schools will have to be aggressive in order to balance their books. And teachers should be prioritized over administrators. From 1992 to 2009, teaching staff increased by 32%, whereas administrative staff increased by 46%. https://t.co/uxozd0R8P6The college experience forges social bonds.
