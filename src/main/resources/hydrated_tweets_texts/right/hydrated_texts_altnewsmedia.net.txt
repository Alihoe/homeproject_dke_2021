@HRaleighspeaks Perhaps a more important driver than One Belt One Road in Italy has been mainland Chinese ownership of factories in Northern Italy &amp; the presence of a hundred thousands workers who came from the Wuhan area.

It explains how and why Italy fell so quickly to the #COVID19. 

3/n@whoisciv @JohnCornyn How about you stop the fear monger BS?

For those still in panic mode.

Italy has 100,000 Wuhan Chinese in Northern Italy, Texas does not.
