From @EPPCdc's George Weigel on Vatican official's reprimand of Cardinal Zen: Doubling Down On a Bad Deal https://t.co/nji6VeSQjvNot so long ago, people hoped that communist China would gradually adopt the values of the democratic West. The opposite may be closer to the case.

https://t.co/8iqShBg0KBAvery is so obviously boyish that Debi feels the need to explain. “I just happen to have a tomboy trans-girl,” she says.
https://t.co/ORsClWQXd1It’s a basic error of logic to think that everything that happened after Vatican II happened because of Vatican II.
https://t.co/to2z9oPRN9"We fear that Christians in Hong Kong will suffer the same fate as Christians in mainland China,” a pastor said. “With our churches being burnt down, our leaders having to be approved, and our Bible being changed to suit Communist propaganda”

https://t.co/gtAfTFnOxFThis is true: “Unless religious leaders reopen the churches, they will appear to value earthly above eternal life.” And many will not come back to church. https://t.co/FLKG6obSuW850 years ago this afternoon, four knights arrived at Canterbury Cathedral, weighed down with armour and accompanied by a large retinue. 

Why does Thomas Becket so often get the blame for what happened next? My essay in the current @firstthingsmag: https://t.co/U9CZubFvBd“China has issued a five-year plan to make Christianity more compatible with “Chinese values.” In mainland China, it is no longer possible to buy a copy of the Bible online, and existing copies are confiscated if unauthorized.” #coronavirus  https://t.co/1HTUUaHv9wFirst Things editor R. R. Reno, whom the COVID episode has revealed to be callously deranged, has now criticized "aging clergy" for worrying that if they defy orders and keep their churches open "they will get the disease and die." Insanity.

https://t.co/GKpYgXqZlLMy new article on the funding behind the Gender Identity Industry (yes, another conservative site because the left won’t touch this) &amp; the new medical identities being normalized by Big Pharma. Please keep sharing. 
https://t.co/Bki6LDf0nnThis can read strange to liberals, but it emerges out of those demographic trends. And many Christian conservatives have convinced themselves that it's happening to them because they can't match the left in ruthlessness. 

See @SohrabAhmari: https://t.co/DWU3Quan0F@ClarkeMicah Just grinding my teeth at Niall Ferguson's article on how 'The US can win the Second Cold War' against China &amp; Russia (he uses caps for the term, so we know it is an actual thing).

https://t.co/Ru6rSa8NDPUnprompted public apologies (like the following by @matthewschmitz) are so rare that we should applaud when they happen. Well done. https://t.co/d9qBZygcutNew lockdowns have descended on Europe, and this time authorities are not imposing restrictions equally.

Instead, churches are subject to the harshest restrictions. Across France, the faithful are fighting back.

See @SohrabAhma… https://t.co/hm043L4at2@ScottAdamsSays a contrary opinion on china from david goldman ("spengler"): https://t.co/ih0lfPaahz.@SecPompeo: The State Department has been a strong voice for religious freedom in China and around the world and has taken steps to hold those who abuse the faithful responsible for their actions. We will continue to do so. https://t.co/eDlq5ZmNRRIn China, church services now begin with songs praising the Communist Party, followed by bowing to giant portraits of Xi Jinping.

https://t.co/bOesfgEqGMThe Gender Identity industry is a massive political coup generated by Big Pharma using already established social acceptance of LGB civil rights to drives its #socialengineering agenda for profit.

Reno is one of the intellectuals pontificating on Covid-19 policy that I would absolutely not trust: https://t.co/QmW311n2hX“It is no surprise that in a secular age, we constantly feel exhausted and vulnerable—without land or temple. We feel the panic of this pandemic within a Babylonian kind of enclosure. Yet the Christian must bear witness to a different faith.” https://t.co/IwfhHmG7KQThe Catholic school is a proven, powerful civilizing force — yet many face closure in the wake of the pandemic. In this great moment of shared economic hardship, Catholic school families deserve federal assistance too. 

My latest. https://t.co/FIjrTywGeIThis is an excellent piece about the Church's responsibilities to the faithful and to the public during a pandemic, and how Christians should respond during a time of fear and sorrow.

https://t.co/EOfztePF6L"the mass shutdown of society to fight the spread of COVID-19 creates a perverse, even demonic atmosphere." 
This, from @rr_reno, represents what @firstthingsmag has become and the dark alleyways some who are associated with it have stumbled into.

"Their reaction was vastly different from ours. They continued to worship, go to musical performances, clash on football fields, and gather with friends." https://t.co/Rk3nKziXtR 2/6It will probably not console Peter Hitchens at all to know that, as the economic consequences of the lockdown unfold, his position will become less lonely. https://t.co/DiMFAZ8kI8Two years ago, the Holy See reached an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party, hoping to help China's Catholics. Yet the CCP’s abuse of the faithful has only gotten worse. The Vatican endangers its moral authority, should it renew the deal. https://t.co/fl0TEnYxKS
