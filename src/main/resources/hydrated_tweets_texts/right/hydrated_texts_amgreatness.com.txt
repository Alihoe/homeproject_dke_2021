https://t.co/ZtEMzy6i6WJust like when I cover climate change, I’ve been scolded (even by friends) for writing any analysis about poor-quality models on COVID-19 and its impact on policy bc I’m not a scientist.

But it’s not a nationwide outbreak as we’ve been warned for weeks—aside from a few other hotspots, NY/NYC is the epicenter of the outbreak, accounting for half the total deaths. Queens in particular... https://t.co/q564Cx6AfGMy article, @theamgreatness:
“Instead of directing our anger at shutdowns or our president, we should direct our anger at the politicians who allowed China to become the menace that it is, &amp; happily allowed countless American jobs to be outsourced there.”

https://t.co/k3DSgID29GAs I wrote here, ILI reporting could indicate the spread of COVID-19 spiked in late January thru February, before widespread testing began. Even with all the hype/hysteria about COVID-19 in March, only one recent spike matched those Jan/Feb rates:

https://t.co/ELxhvBphNXAs I wrote here after analyzing CDC flu-like illness data from Jan-February, there’s a strong chance COVID infections already surged before testing was available in March:

https://t.co/m6XHwO06ZKFauci Jan 21: COVID isn’t a serious threat

Fauci Feb 28: COVID as deadly as severe flu

Fauci March 11: COVID 10x deadlier than flu

Fauci March 15: People need to “hunker down”

Fauci April 2: We need a national shutdown

Too many blown calls: https://t.co/hwpBkIaHsrNY accounts for about 40% of all reported COVID-related deaths.
