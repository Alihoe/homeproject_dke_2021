https://t.co/lS4GVdiZ2mChina was appointed on Wed to the UN Human Rights Council panel where it will play a key role in picking the world body’s human rights investigators.

These moves within the UN degrade and weaken the credibility of the organisation (or what is left of it). https://t.co/v4xKru2DSnI don’t reflexively dislike the U.N., and no country has a perfect human rights record, including of course my own. But it seems worth noting that China is currently committing genocide. 

https://t.co/KBl8ggTYjEYes, and  China will play a central role in choosing these U.N. experts on Arbitrary Detentions &amp; on Disappearances

Electing the regimes of China, Russia and Cuba to the world's highest human rights body is like making Dracula in charge of the blood bank.

A terrible way to open the new year of 2021, @UNHumanRights.
