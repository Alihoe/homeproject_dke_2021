That’s what we’re learning as we examine the work of a #Trump-supporter who has uncovered all the proof necessary to dispel this myth that Joe #Biden won the presidential election.

https://t.co/HvVImueoTtData deep dive on Dominion Voting Systems offers incontrovertible proof of election hac @sendavidperdue @KLoeffler @GovKemp @GaSecofState ...GA REpublican votes went to Dems and some just disappeared! https://t.co/zq9HBbHBxDIt’s up to @realDonaldTrump's team to determine if any voter fraud took place.

What @CodeMonkeyZ has demonstrated is how easy voter fraud could happen through Dominion Voting Systems if someone chose to do so. https://t.co/jVt3yJYL93@DonaldJTrumpJr Here's how they were able to launch their technological coup so easily.

It appears the software was designed to be easily manipulated by a very small number of people. https://t.co/jVt3yJYL93So...data shows Dominion Voting Systems linked to Soros and Pelosi lost or flipped votes in Pennsylvania, Georgia (way more than Biden leads), Michigan (plus Kayleigh proved massive voter fraud there), Arizona...

https://t.co/NwbkbpGa0QThe left did as it is wont to do by going after one of the few sane medical voices who have the President’s ear.

But as @SWAtlasHoover noted, it’s time for the people to have their voices heard.

These draconian lockdowns must end now. https://t.co/ha8VvgxssXDemocrats were ferocious towards voting machine companies for three years.

Earlier this year, just as Joe Biden was being anointed, they suddenly stopped attacking companies like Dominion Voting Systems.

Hmm. https://t.co/No6IrAx1ZSHypocritical California lawmakers attend conference in Maui while common folks suffer through lockdowns https://t.co/5dJKA2BH1qLet's recall that the inefficacy of masks was St. Fauci's original position; they might make you psychologically feel better, but they will not stop virus transmission.

If their claims can be proven, it will likely force the state board to reverse the results or to send it to the legislature to select electors. https://t.co/poiKDXU4N8Every quick “loss” for Team Trump in district and appellate courts helps to usher us closer to the real battlefront in the Supreme Court.

Prove us wrong, Joe. https://t.co/iOoxST00DHDO THE DEMS STILL CLAIM THAT THEY WEREN’T INVOLVED IN THE  CHINA/SOROS VOTER FRAUD SCHEME WHEN DEM GOVERNORS PAID MILLIONS FOR DOMINION’S MACHINES?

Could the SolarWinds Orion raid yield smoking gun evidence about Dominion voter fraud? https://t.co/5maU6nxebfGoogle is arguably the biggest culprit when it comes to controlling the narrative for the left. They consider it their demonic duty to keep people misinformed.

We are sheep for allowing this to happen. But we have choices. Make a good one and dump Google. https://t.co/quZ8SZKCk6Leftist media’s agenda to spread fear and shame those who aren’t cowering from their narrative is both hypocritical and embarrassing.

But patriots like Andy are ready to call them out. h/t @EddieZipperer @Deana921 https://t.co/58y4GciJyeIt would be ironic if the backdoor to Dominion Voting Systems through #SolarWinds Orion happened to be the way massive voter fraud was unambiguously revealed to the world.

Cross your fingers. https://t.co/kTlVJjTcCcWe need a bombshell so big that media will look like hacks to everyone, even Democrats, if they suppress it.

We need this in the next 15 days, or within two weeks after that.

https://t.co/bjyuiZ6ixL Will the Supreme Court give the Trump campaign a win before Christmas?

That’s possible.

But the underlying agenda of Team Trump seems to be much bigger than this one filing.

We should see big things happening this week. @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani https://t.co/6antWJjrneIt’s understandable that many are pushing for the coronavirus vaccine.

Much of the nation is living in fear driven by the current narrative.

But the least they can do is deliver the unfiltered truth.

This video will be suppressed. h/t @JeffTheGK  https://t.co/DVVH2VcgCbPeople are falling through the cracks.

But many of this nation’s problems can be solved if we simply open up for business.

We can do so as safely as possible, but it must be done immediately.

The longer the lockdown lasts, the more people will suffer. https://t.co/1JaEhiOqnE@10903 @lissasno1fan @Katheri73214366 @Liberty_Belle04 @KatTheWonk @kybetra @club_ed8 @MarthaW19860146 @klj998866 @RockwaterReport @garyelam11 @daveycrokett @cspanwj @Grandbulldoggie @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @FLOTUS @Kybelle195739 @Torrid_Zone @Lucy2300090 @ranchdancer @marklevinshow @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 @_SilentMaj0rity @writergary @RealJamesWoods @RealDeanCain @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump @rcdaviesbooks @kayleighmcenany @RudyGiuliani @cspan @WhiteHouse @Mike_Pence @JennaEllisEsq @GOP @jessejholland @HouseGOP @GOPLeader @newsmax @RepSwalwell @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @PLEchevarria @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Many thanks Pedro for mentioning what is going to happen on January 6th 2021, game over for #HarrisBiden that will overturn unconstitutional insurrection perpetrated by @DNC cheaters who perpetrated #VoterFraud especially in #SwingStates

https://t.co/gzLP6wYCmlThe sooner more people realize the lockdowns are about control and have little to no effect on COVID-19, the easier it will be to rally the people to oppose these senseless policies once and for all. https://t.co/LMwi92Ysa0.@realDonaldTrump should send the bill back to DC and demand all pork be stripped from it immediately.

And if they don’t, then they’ll have to override his veto.

Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell are snakes wallowing in their swamp. https://t.co/iQPbq7TALxWhile President Trump is doing a heroic job building up our forces to counteract China; Beijing Biden has been sabotaging. And the media which has accused Trump of Russia collusion has been covering up the real collusion with China &amp; the Democrats.  https://t.co/2yfo97V5PcKnowing that average ICU capacity in Los Angeles in December is over 90% any given year, Gavin Newsom knew we’d hit his 85% trigger.

Instead of increasing capacity, he simply prepared to enforce his inevitable draconian lockdown.

Why? https://t.co/jQLKHiY9uRIf there’s a doctor we’d recommend to advise @realDonaldTrump on the coronavirus instead of Dr. Fauci, it would be @drdavidsamadi.

His predictions have been spot-on and his understanding of how to move forward is unparalleled. Listen to this interview. https://t.co/F5u2slrZgVListening to @laurenboebert’s passion for American and perspectives on how to get this country back on track during the coronavirus crisis was truly inspiring.

This interview is a must-listen for patriots across the nation. #CO03 https://t.co/xbU8DQklLGIf California and New York were run like Texas and Florida, their economies would be better off and the people may even be safer from the coronanvirus.

As Governor @GregAbbott_TX noted, progressive policies do not equate to smart governance. https://t.co/AlQ7hB36XgThere is no need for a staged re-opening of America.

Every stage preserves part of a bad prescription.

At this point we know that COVID-19 isn’t nearly as deadly as feared. @vidzette  https://t.co/A9SqX2L7RgAt this point, it’s crystal clear to those paying attention that the left is determined to prolong the lockdown as long as possible, not for the sake of saving lives but to achieve their political goals. https://t.co/zInbCHISICIt’s crystal clear that the murder of George Floyd is now an afterthought for these “protesters.”

They’re being use to promote anarchy and bring down this nation.

We must not let that happen. https://t.co/yfVjYV9uZZPresident invokes Impoundment Control Act of 1974, redlining areas of concern in COVID-19 relief bill https://t.co/3nQtvmMEGY@MaryamHenein Gavin Newsom’s ICU ‘trigger’ for lockdowns is below average December ICU numbers.

Unfortunately, the scientists promoted by most in mainstream media have been hand-selected because their narrative aligns with the left’s agenda.

It’s the lockdowns that have created this atmosphere of anger and desperation. https://t.co/nUHzrqsIH6As long our leaders allow their decisions to be driven almost exclusively by the “approved” doctors, we’re going to continue these piecemeal “ends” to the lockdowns.

We need to hear all of the facts.
