https://t.co/qMD7UYRsUyA McCarthyite climate has descended on Britain. If you question the shutting-down of society in response to Covid-19, you’ll be branded insane and dangerous. People will call for you to be arrested. This extreme intolerance must end, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/lTsMKCbSBpIslamists around the world are exploiting Covid-19. They are using it to peddle anti-American conspiracy theories and to urge their followers to violent acts. The depravity of these people knows no bounds, writes @rakibehsan
https://t.co/mdtTFKXES7If left-wingers truly believed we have a ‘hard right’ government, then would they really be cheering on the #Covid19 lockdown so vigorously? Some lefties say it doesn’t go far enough. Ash Sarkar has called for a ban on *all public contact*. This is madness
https://t.co/Ka3UdiOzWYIf the only role assigned to us now is to stay at home, we will deprive communities of the ability to contribute to the resolution of the crisis. Government cannot have the answer to every situation. We must trust people’s judgement, says @Furedibyte
https://t.co/wRKzEh2XryAmazing that President Woodrow Wilson never uttered a word in public about the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19. https://t.co/WhyGXenhLkLots of lefties are relishing the lockdown a little too much. Not long ago, they said the Tories were hard right. Now they say the police state is not repressive enough. Are they not remotely concerned about this clampdown? #Covid19

https://t.co/zGASJxMRFQEnvironmentalists are claiming that Covid-19 is a “warning” from nature. They think this pandemic is nature’s way of punishing human beings for being evil and destructive. This is backward, misanthropic nonsense, says Brendan O’Neill 
https://t.co/vrxerowZEiThis by Jennie Bristow is genuinely one of best things I've read on social significance of dealing w COVID-19. Hope it's widely shared &amp; its messages on intergenerational social solidarity taken to heart. Literally could be life saving; politically crucial https://t.co/WJVJzl0Uc9Covid-19 has given us a glimpse of what life would be like if environmentalists ever got their way. Less flying, no industry, infrastructure put on hold... this is the dystopia greens want to build. Let’s get back to modernity ASAP, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/vrxerowZEiWe have to stop sneering at ‘armchair epidemiologists’. Everyone, including non-experts, has a right to discuss the Covid-19 crisis. Indeed, our questions are exactly what will keep the experts on their toes, says @Norm_Lewis
https://t.co/SxDaEavFrVCorbynistas see Covid-19 as an opportunity to foist their political worldview on the country. Ian Lavery says it is an “opportunity” for Labour. This is the Socialism of Ghouls. They are using a disease to score political points, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/HA3JoJBSmLThe Italian government has no discernible strategy for dealing with coronavirus. It failed early on to test arrivals from Wuhan, even after banning flights from China. Its current policy is reactive and is getting ever more draconian, says @DomStandish
https://t.co/Ru21t8e5LXChloe Middleton was reported this week as the UK’s youngest coronavirus victim. She was held up as proof of why the young should take the virus seriously. But her death wasn’t recorded as a Covid-19 death, and she had not tested positive for the virus
https://t.co/mJqyNGES1QChloe Middleton was reported as the UK’s youngest Covid-19 victim. But her death has not been recorded as such. This tragedy was too swiftly leapt upon and turned into a cautionary tale, purely because it aligned with some people’s worst fears:
https://t.co/mJqyNGES1Q"And it’s a liberty under threat. The speed and intensity with which questioning extreme responses to Covid-19 has become tantamount to a speechcrime is alarming.”  https://t.co/VcDJkXnU1bThe coronavirus crisis reminds us how dysfunctional monarchy is. Prince Charles jumps the queue for a test purely by dint of his birth. His son then steps up in terms of royal duties, with no input from the public, writes Tessa Mayes Clarke
https://t.co/CSXwW54LdATargeted lockdowns of towns like Vo’ Euganeo have been effective in containing coronavirus. But Italy’s national lockdown is a disaster. It has spread resources far too thinly and has turned a health crisis into a social one, says @DomStandish
https://t.co/Ru21t8e5LXThere’s something ugly in the social-media shaming of people strolling in parks or getting on Tube trains. This online rage is less about helping the fight against Covid-19 and more about getting a moral thrill from denouncing people, says @Tom_Slater_

https://t.co/3l7xRQiV9XIt feels like in the past few weeks we've walked into another universe. Normal life has been upended. And yet you aren’t even allowed to question this. Whatever the wisdom of the lockdown, we need more debate, not less, says @InayaFolarin
https://t.co/9m6WaR9UeuCovid-19 is a virus. It pays no heed to race or religion. That's why the government's public-health advice pays no heed to identity politics. Because a universal threat requires unified action, says Leyla Sanai
https://t.co/TdsEgiRp0LOwen Jones campaigned for the lockdown, now he’s saying it’s racist. News that the first person wrongly charged under new coronavirus laws is black has given him a rude awakening. Does he only support a police state if it’s sufficiently intersectional?

https://t.co/OKRRZl6YmXSome woke leftists seem to be enjoying the Covid crisis. They gleefully point to the daily death toll as proof of how evil the Tories are and how useless Britain is. This is nasty Britain-bashing. Please stop this sick Schadenfreude, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/iPHGWZU7oNStop saying that Angela Merkel or Jacinda Ardern are better at tackling coronavirus because they’re women and naturally more thoughtful and compassionate. It’s insulting. This is a PC revival of the ‘gentler sex’ stereotype, writes @Ella_M_Whelan

https://t.co/JOAQYOhPoxThis is worth a final RT, after today's @spikedonline pod with @FraserMyers, @Tom_Slater_ , and @Ella_M_Whelan...my original Spiked piece empirically comparing lockdowns to plain social distancing across the U.S. states. Read it here: https://t.co/zj7gqtQKJi@Cody_Robison OK.  9 billion people will die before the end of the year.  Guaranteed to be less than that.

Lockdowns have NOT proven to be the most effective.  They have mixed results at best.  https://t.co/8pogOIsVVa"There's no evidence that lockdowns work.

Why the WHO should be scrapped https://t.co/5VdfHraXWaWhy, in the middle of a pandemic, is the WHO calling for access to alcohol to be restricted?

https://t.co/duHKRbUa3gIt’s time to ease the lockdown for the under-50s. By keeping young people inside, even though they face few risks from Covid-19, we are merely delaying the onset of herd immunity and causing unnecessary deaths, writes @MartinKulldorff
https://t.co/qMH879QV55Very good points from @FraserMyers | How the lockdown fuelled the care-homes crisis - spiked https://t.co/LYOa8MEa51A town in Spain has sprayed its beach with bleach to ‘protect children’. A town in Sweden has covered its park in chicken manure. UK police dyed a blue lagoon black to make it less picturesque. Across Europe, the responses to Covid19 keep getting madder.
https://t.co/CiVmc8U5m4The EU has been utterly exposed by the Covid-19 crisis. It has failed to help Italy through its suffering, and nation states are doing their own thing rather than following Brussels’ rules. The EU doesn’t deserve to survive this crisis, says @FraserMyers
https://t.co/oRs92ZJL5yItaly &amp; Spain top the EU league table of Covid-19-related deaths. Given the international nature of the pandemic, the need for cross-border cooperation is obvious, the kind of problem that a ‘European Union’ should be well placed to tackle. #AbjectFailure  https://t.co/5gKXXoWY1CThe EU has badly bungled its response to coronavirus. Christine Lagarde and Ursula von der Leyen have both made major gaffes in appearing to dismiss Italy’s plight. The only sensible thing the EU can do is get out of the way, says @FraserMyers
https://t.co/oRs92ZJL5yThanks to the EU's incompetent and callous handling of the coronavirus crisis, Yanis Varoufakis has finally realised something. That the EU is utterly unreformable. And Brexit was right. What took him so long?, asks Tim Black

https://t.co/GTpm7EP7mJI feel like I have woken up in a Kafka novel. Today a policeman reprimanded me for sitting on a park bench and writing a text message. You might have expected that in the USSR, but in Hyde Park? We are moving towards a corona-tyranny, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/8oHcOojz49The EU has been utterly exposed by the Covid-19 crisis. It has failed to help Italy through its suffering, and nation states are doing their own thing rather than following Brussels’ rules. The EU doesn’t deserve to survive this crisis, says @FraserMyers
https://t.co/oRs92ZJL5yThe police are out of control. Today in Hyde Park I saw them reprimanding a man for sitting under a tree, telling people off for texting, and lecturing a couple for “selfishly” being outdoors. The Covid-cops are a law unto themselves, says Brendan O’Neill

https://t.co/8oHcOojz49Those demanding more restrictions on people’s movement from the comfort of their back gardens need to recognise their own privilege. Tightening the lockdown would disproportionately impact on the poor, mentally ill and isolated, writes @JoyIeuan
https://t.co/iEy36XA4FrAccess to London’s parks, many of them established to provide access to fresh air for the poor, are now being denied to the local population for no good reason. The risk of giving someone coronavirus in a park is negligible, says Dr Michael Fitzpatrick

https://t.co/Rt43uYPIYEEmily Maitlis’s government-bashing lecture on Newsnight was the BBC at its worst. It was biased, patrician and staggeringly hypocritical. The media elite agitated for the Covid lockdown — they can’t now complain about its dire impact, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/Rt43uYPIYEOn Newsnight Emily Maitlis said we need to be kinder to poor people in the wake of Covid-19. Yet poor people can be dragged to court if they fail to pay the TV license fee that funds Maitlis’s huge wages. The hypocrisy is awful, says Brendan O’Neill

 https://t.co/1E78Z8f1Nj“Any reasonable expert — ie, not Neil Ferguson — knows lockdown can’t change the final number of infections. Some say we prevented the collapse of hospitals. But look at Sweden. No lockdown and no collapse of hospitals.”

Yoram Lass on Covid-19:
https://t.co/6y6EaAxzBI"There is a palpable desire for Sweden to fail. Too many people are so invested in the lockdown strategy because no one wants to admit we've done this horrible thing to our country for no reason."

Lionel Shriver on The Brendan O'Neill Show: https://t.co/QpwuNMTlVC https://t.co/RClBblGKvGThere is a huge amount of scientific debate over Covid-19 and how we should respond to it. But YouTube is now censoring that debate. A video of Knut Wittkowski, an epidemiologist and critic of lockdown, has been removed.
https://t.co/PAGA6ItpWOWhile the country is forced to live under house arrest to ‘Protect the NHS’, the NHS is discharging patients who may still have Covid back into care homes. It’s no wonder deaths are soaring there. This is madness, says @FraserMyers
https://t.co/DQXOtRdsIoScotland’s lockdown is the latest in a long line of assaults on Scottish people’s liberty. At the same time as Nicola Sturgeon makes orders to stay at home, the government is introducing new hate-speech laws to attack free speech, says @CarltonBrick
https://t.co/2S3VALmEow#DominicCummings broke the #lockdown ? Good https://t.co/Dnl0uRILc5Germany is spending a whopping €1 trillion to rescue its economy. These measures may be welcome. But there is a danger that all Germany’s problems will be blamed on #Covid19. In truth, the slump has been a long time coming, says Sabine Beppler-Spahl
https://t.co/BaEmWAUiKN"Boris is still saying that 500,000 people would have died without the lockdown. This is nonsense. Why doesn't the government trust people enough to tell the truth? We need an adult debate about the trade-offs."

@Tom_Slater_ on the spiked podcast: https://t.co/qZGlCMnHXD https://t.co/p7ElwxvR9UThe lockdown of the advanced economies is not only taking a heavy toll domestically. It also threatens to push many inhabitants of the world's poorest countries to the brink of starvation. This threatens to be a man-made catastrophe, says @danielbenami
https://t.co/8SvI5k8QcwThe reason the media elite despises Dominic Cummings is because they see him as being responsible for Brexit. They aren’t gunning for him because he broke the lockdown but because he shattered their cosy self-serving pro-EU consensus, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/aX7O6E68DP@paulhowey @rodbishop15 @NEUnion This interview with epidemiologist Knu Wittkowski makes it clear there is no longer rationale for lockdown, no epidemiological reason for distancing, herd immunity is imminent. Pls share. https://t.co/b4S0b2Fz8LFacebook has deleted posts about anti-lockdown protests. YouTube has deleted a video of doctors arguing for lockdown to be lifted. This cannot go on. Social media companies must not be the arbiters of truth on Covid, or anything else, writes @Tom_Slater_
https://t.co/61sbseFapCTough to listen to @piersmorgan rant about care-homes crisis. 
Covid hysterics like him pulled public gaze away from obvious problem of elderly affliction, in favour of whipping up wider fear &amp; dread, &amp; disgust with people sitting in parks.
FEAR KILLS
https://t.co/zNnOGjHc2kLeftists fantasise about a future with no growth and no work. But as Karl Marx pointed out, even a ‘child knows that any nation that stopped working would perish’. In reality, we have to get back to work and make good on our losses, says @jamesheartfield
https://t.co/txu8r94vmWWe should all be wary of the authoritarian consequences of lockdown. It’s easy to snark at anti-lockdown protesters. But hard-won liberties have been overturned overnight, and 'benevolent’ technocrats have got things very wrong before, says @gregorbas1
https://t.co/70mUK3x2l5We were told the lockdown was necessary to prevent the NHS from being overrun by Covid cases. The NHS was never overrun. Some hospitals are half-empty. Cases of Covid have fallen dramatically. Why on earth are we still locked down?, asks Brendan O’Neill

https://t.co/zZxxzvJg50Dissenting doctors have been booted off YouTube. State governments are nudging Facebook to delete anti-lockdown protests. Big Tech censorship has spread at an alarming rate during this pandemic. It’s time to flatten the curve, says @Tom_Slater_
https://t.co/61sbseFapCThe government has utterly failed to protect care homes. Staff struggled to get PPE and tests. And instead of shielding the elderly and vulnerable, the virus was imported into homes from hospitals in order to ‘Protect the NHS’, writes @FraserMyers
https://t.co/71ki49qwH5Instead of providing leadership, our politicians have only helped to spread needless fear. It is time for the UK to come out of lockdown, but when even MPs are refusing to go back to work, you can see why the public are reluctant, says @jowilliams293
https://t.co/05vFAKVoWuIt isn’t only Covid-19 that poses a threat to human health — so does the lockdown. It is now thought that thousands of Brits have died because of the suspension of normal health services. Our obsession with Covid has become dangerous, says Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/cJ1iFLaz48"We need to save life. We need to make sure we don’t completely trash the economy. But we also need each other, at closer range than the state-approved two metres. Social distancing cannot become the new normal. It corrodes society – and the soul" 

My col https://t.co/Eo74IDnsE4The lockdown is causing economic devastation. Britain is heading for its worst economic crunch on record. Hundreds of millions of people around the world risk losing their livelihoods. Why is the left supporting this madness?, asks Brendan O’Neill
https://t.co/EIEH4rndJ0In the heat of the war on terror, leftists and liberals rightly slammed the politics of fear. Yet where are those voices now in the war on corona? They are busy calling on the state to crush our freedoms in the name of security, says Tim Black
