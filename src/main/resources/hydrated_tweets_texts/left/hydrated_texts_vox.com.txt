One of the most uncomfortable possibilities is that it doesn't —until there's a vaccine https://t.co/5pJ1gKTiAxThere’s now evidence that people who do not show severe symptoms can spread it silently. Another reason is the slow rollout of diagnostic tests in the US &amp; other countries has made it hard to see where it's spreading

How does the coronavirus outbreak end? https://t.co/xPVgcvQqpBThey worked at scale - beds, ventilators, oxygen, CTs, and labs. And they had problems with all of those supplies at different points.
