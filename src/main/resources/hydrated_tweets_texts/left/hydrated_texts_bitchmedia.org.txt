Your eyebrows should crinkle every single time Dr. Fauci or any other medical professional counts "obesity" as one of the compounding conditions for COVID-19. Thank you making it plain, @theclaudster. https://t.co/3Zmxo0bAGn"Put bluntly: The almost exclusive focus on individual risk that has characterized U.S. public discourse on COVID persists because institutions tasked with substantially lightening individual risk burdens can’t or won’t do their damn jobs."

When you assume that people are able-bodied because they’re young, you’re being ableist."

https://t.co/PLvfjxNFDd via @bitchmediaI wrote about struggling with compulsive shopping in the midst of COVID-19 and the potential collapse of the Postal Service.

My latest for @BitchMedia: https://t.co/jByUZKPkCL“Before you hit send on that tweet that laments having to stay home and missing out on that school event, concert, or trip you were looking forward to, consider that such experiences are commonplace for disabled and chronically ill folks.” https://t.co/ZQfHy44nn7For @BitchMedia, I wrote about the strain that the coronavirus pandemic has put on abortion providers and clinic escorts, and why the refusal of many anti-choice protesters to cease in the face of it is only making it worse. https://t.co/NrdhiGgK3z#AnimalCrossingNewHorizons is one of the few things reminding me that joy exists even under so much uncertainty and grief.

Over at @BitchMedia, I chatted about how it's an effective treatment for my mental health during quarantine:

https://t.co/5icNZephCO https://t.co/Qy4rMmMvfQ“the anti-choice movement isn’t about saving lives at all. If anti-choicers cared to save lives they wouldn’t support a supposedly pro-life president whose fumbled COVID-19 response allowed more than 200,000 Americans to die...” #ProLifeHypocrisy https://t.co/p7YYuEPZex“Clinton shored up 40 years of coordinated effort to give anti-trans advocacy the appearance of a broad base of support.” https://t.co/QYpCIMATSr“Still though, celebrities are treated as if their bodies can be placed on our cultural exam tables at any time, dissected by us anytime there’s a mere shift in their appearance.” @freeblackgirl https://t.co/3mzrqdhxdzWe can’t deny that this pandemic is heavily impacting our relationships in ways that most of us are unequipped to handle. https://t.co/vYqxmCtpLKThe COVID-19 crisis has thrown into sharp relief the deep inequality undergirding our society, fueled by gaping holes in our social safety net. https://t.co/WJqvTbJSQw (via @GrimKim).@BitchMedia amplifies our story on a pregnant woman who nearly died due to Catholic hospital policies: "@Rewire_News’s reporting puts the human cost of such practices in Catholic hospitals at the forefront of reproductive healthcare conversations." https://t.co/9ZrUW3PhgAEarly on in the pandemic, @BrookeKnisley pitched this idea about the impact on immunocompromised educators. It was the perfect angle at the perfect time. Brooke has that ability to just know where the conversation is going. https://t.co/XmQ5H3H9hw“Put disabled workers first for once; after all, we have the best hacks for surviving social distancing.” https://t.co/BihtsL6P2C“No one is coming to save us. That shouldn’t be cause for alarm; if anything, it’s a chance for people to...fight for a truly revolutionary vision of liberation.” @GrimKim wrote this powerful meditation about who we can be after this pandemic ends. https://t.co/WIPqxk2Scc11 Podcasts Feminists Should Listen to While Social Distancing | Bitch Media https://t.co/Jokq9FeRZPPoint: Awkwafina became the first Asian American to win Best Actress. 

Counterpoint: Awkwafina stepped into the spotlight thanks in part to her appropriating AAVE. #GoldenGlobes https://t.co/8AVAIofofzShelters across the United States have been inundated with new domestic violence cases, but many of them aren’t equipped with the resources to meet the needs of deaf, deafblind, or other survivors with disabilities. @BitchMedia 
https://t.co/WkKCEHchMIAbortion providers are also on the frontlines of this pandemic, and they're continuing to provide that essential care in the face of even MORE protesters than usual. My latest for @BitchMedia on the difficulty of providing abortion amid coronavirus: https://t.co/NrdhiGgK3z"There’s also an inherent ableism in able-bodied people complaining about having to work from home or, even worse, going to work when they’re feeling" https://t.co/cgB68Ufejl via @bitchmedia 

#HighRiskCovid19 #COVID19 #COVID19 #COVID2019 #SpoonieChat #CripTheVoteYES BITCH (and @BitchMedia). @ms_creilly again hits the nail on the head. You can talk about coronavirus without being an ableist asshole. Try it :)

https://t.co/m5YQZkQxTI"The lack of accessible information about the coronavirus in ASL is compounding the domestic violence crisis for deaf survivors. 'Information deprivation increases risks [of] isolation and abuse,' Erasmus said."

A crucial report from @BitchMedia: https://t.co/WzClSShI4fWith the very gracious insight of @cannibality and Leo from the NSW tenants union, I wrote about what COVID-19 might mean for the future of political action/organising/surveillance/everything https://t.co/ogYMYI3q19“People are arguing that COVID-19 is the earth’s vaccine against humans as the virus wreaks havoc around the world, killing thousands of people, many of whom are working-class and don’t have access to healthcare.” https://t.co/hllaG6h9inDenial of needed healthcare, like what my spouse experienced, is quite common for trans people across the US.

#HighRiskCovid19 #COVID19 #COVID19 #COVID2019 #SpoonieChat #CripTheVote“Any type of disaster or tragedy the United States has ever had, whether it be a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or, in this case, a pandemic, abortion care is still needed.” https://t.co/W6iM9WzrY3I don't know anyone who isn't financially strapped right now. But: I'm asking you to buy or give a subscription; to join our membership program, The Rage; to share this post; to do what you can to help us meet our $75,000 fundraising goal by tomorrow. https://t.co/MdsgtZrVax48 million Deaf and hard of hearing people in the U.S. are in danger of experiencing domestic violence during the pandemic. Many of the services designed to help them escape don't accommodate their disability or have dwindling resources. This is a crisis. https://t.co/DI0jg45HQrWorld on Fire: Environmental Racism and COVID-19 Are a Deadly Combination

“Ultimately, the only cure for environmental racism is to entirely dismantle the structures that allow it to fester.”

https://t.co/uheOjI08Jz"In April 2020, the United Nations warned that six months of quarantine could lead to 31 million additional cases of domestic violence globally—but the outlook for deaf women is especially dire." https://t.co/tu8q4DEtPx“While abled actors are often cast as disabled characters, disabled actors are rarely tapped to play characters whose lives don’t center around disability.” https://t.co/EbhDZm3TJp“...it’s disappointing to see @ELLEmagazine , a magazine for and by women, mask such an important conversation and choose maintaining access to Paltrow and other celebrities over something as important as healthcare.” https://t.co/t0ofb8v6WB"Ultimately, the only cure for environmental #racism is to entirely dismantle the structures that allow it to fester."

Covid-19 has amplified the already existing environmental + medical racism.
