We can afford universal policies on healthcare, childcare, &amp; education, if we choose to

Doctor and ‘Atlantic’ staff writer James Hamblin, the author of the one good story on COVID-19, unpacks what we should be worried about.  https://t.co/MuGQksDtQABernie Sanders is building a strong coalition of Burlington Coat Factory shoppers, Kohls cash collectors, and Maxxinistas. 
https://t.co/VSEfQjbR9XRemember when literally all of this happened already? https://t.co/LpoCUJ12cbFreeing detainees protects all your constituents, because prisons are porous.  Concrete walls will keep in detainees, but not this virus.
 
You must empty the detention centers before the first outbreak occurs, or there will be no turning back.

Many thanks to @BrandyLJensen for making it happen! https://t.co/wnXoV5aeKhThe Buttigieg's Instagram gaffe at a Holocaust memorial is definitely corny, but it's also what happens when tragedy is memorialized in the abstract. https://t.co/cyE6LqEb8S“This is the first time a celebrity has accused me of having sex with dogs. It has not happened since.” https://t.co/RnL22Fi8FA"Do you feel like you’re going fucking crazy?

https://t.co/ygNZEwf93AIsrael Military's twitter account  "appears to have figured out what looks like its final form, which is something like Denny’s account crossed with what the LiveJournal page of the British army in India might have looked like at the height of the Raj" 

https://t.co/Su1FNu6JqLMost Democrats have conceded the premise for Trump’s act of war. We should have an actual opposition, not the party that let Iraq happen. https://t.co/SFQPWA30NvWrote about Brexit finally happening and how the world spirit, it turns out, is Bart Simpson https://t.co/TNt248GahBYou know this was far from the most crucial thing The Outline ever published but it was the rare article that was so effective I immediately all but stopped seeing the thing it was critiquing. I'm sure it lingers but it somehow got banished from my orbit. https://t.co/Dm8TdKHeiuTo really end homelessness, we need policy changes:

- more shelters, affordable housing, rent control
- healthcare for all  w/ mental health, long-term care
- more full-time jobs with benefits
- a living wage

https://t.co/EcILpU3o0fI interviewed Picardi about the state of LGBTQ media over the summer and things then were, frankly, grim. They appear to be getting grimmer. https://t.co/W5x9jyWwMbRemember when literally all of this happened already? @AlbertBurneko at @outline: https://t.co/x4Ypwz8IzXIf people can be made to blame each other for the disaster that is being wrought on us by coronavirus, then they are much less likely to turn the blame on their leaders as well. 
https://t.co/CaDcNgO43sSomehow reading design critiques of "how to battle the Coronavirus" info graphics brought a small amount of calm to my anxiety ridden brain. 

https://t.co/fprfrSaiYaPete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris had cool parents. What happened? 
https://t.co/bATk4rgUm2This is a great article about what happens when someone with a massive platform punches down at someone with a much smaller platform. https://t.co/iLwc1BjaVO“When the actual actions and consequences that constitute politics are secondary to the appearance of propriety, it becomes possible to salvage its worst elements. It also excuses complicity and collaboration.” https://t.co/mgkXnqql2ZWash your damn hands even when it isn't pandemic season!

'Fox Sports hack Clay Travis is spreading the worst possible coronavirus advice' via @outline https://t.co/N4LIiDDAgRWe're all in a feedback loop of very, very scary information. Here are some sites that can give you a break from a Covid-19 onslaught.
https://t.co/SzHQueN26gDeadspin was (is) the first site I look at in the morning.  Really sad to see this happening. :(

What’s happening at Deadspin is a travesty https://t.co/MCUYE7rCRS via @outlineI think this is a pretty good take on something that most people (myself included) are not really equipped to talk about intelligently right now https://t.co/SEfViWt61w“No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment,” tweeted Joe Biden.
