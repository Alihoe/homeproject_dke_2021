The review of Trump’s life is only beginning now. It will probably tell us that Trump is not merely a politician who has abused his power, or a businessman who has cut corners. He is a criminal who happened to be elected president.“Over the past six months, the coronavirus has often been called a ‘fire drill’ for climate change. But at present it looks more like a white-noise machine, drowning out what would be, in any other year, the unmistakable signal of a climate emergency.” https://t.co/Csvms8YsI3Want a bird's eye overview of the state of western climate politics in the age of Covid?
