NYC prisons are a crisis within this crisis. Nearly 200 people in the prison system have tested positive for COVID-19 &amp; there is no way to keep incarcerated people safe. 

In my op-ed, I call for us to release people NOW &amp; begin to permanently decarcerate.

"History is a very dark comedy whose jokes unfold slowly, and Trump’s spectacularly failed response to this pandemic is the actual punchline to Reagan’s attempt at making fun of big government.
