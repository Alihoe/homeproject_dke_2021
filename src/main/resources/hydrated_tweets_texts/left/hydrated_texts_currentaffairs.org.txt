beyond important read. a few minutes long and vital to seeing through wartime propaganda and understanding what’s going in the world without nationalism clouding your perception of what’s really happening“We urgently need to remember who Biden is and think carefully about what would happen if he were chosen.” https://t.co/paYKNreuHP #Bernie2020@TheStephenWood on how sometimes, the mask just slips off.

https://t.co/gtTrjqILtCIt should not take a pandemic for European leaders to realize that the situation in the Aegean refugee camps is intolerable, and has been for years. https://t.co/OawJmyy1uRThe worst thing that could happen right now is for people to assume that because Bernie is doing reasonably well, he doesn’t need them or they can become complacent. In fact, we should assume we’re not going to win without renewed effort. https://t.co/u1DpM61eSY“If Larry Summers is appalled by the callousness of a cost-benefit argument, you know it’s bad”: https://t.co/fZ8LdvIyeK (via @curaffairs &amp; @NathanJRobinson). 

#COVID2019 #ReopenAmerica #DieForTheDow #CoronavirusLockdown #QuarantineLife #NotDyingForWallStreet #WednesdayWisdom@FemaleBernieBro @CapaTosta122 Nathan Robinson wrote a great piece about Not Biden, and it appears nobody read it. https://t.co/6AytdTR8eKThe amount of revolution that is “enough” these days appears to be “as much as you want as long as it’s totally fictional.”   NEW by @lyta_gold: https://t.co/yMvzZFSrPcEvery worker is entitled to be safe from abuse, infection, or arbitrary firing. #FightFor15 https://t.co/oqrAjaDM0MThe US admits Russia isn't trying to hurt vaccine research but only to create a new vaccine. Yet they're accused of a nefarious plot (to stop coronavirus more quickly). Nobody questions the evil of keeping vaccine research secret for commercial purposes. https://t.co/1wk6AyRJIjOur editor in chief @NathanJRobinson with a new pandemic dispatch: @billmaher is wrong that ‘Chinese Virus’ an innocuous geographical descriptor. https://t.co/CRHs4AGQwm@CNNPolitics After vetting like this, no: @lyta_gold: fun thing I learned while writing my Cuomo article: few years ago state of New York gamed out a pandemic scenario much like this one realized out they were tons of ventilators short...&amp; Cuomo decided not to buy more
https://t.co/ba2SDuOLp8"Why on earth should the Russian government put the intellectual property rights of U.S. pharmaceuticals above the duty to protect the public health of Russians?" https://t.co/WNYburnMRMBritain has an NHS because socialists refused to accept the status quo. The NHS’ so-called father, Aneurin Bevan, was a staunch democratic socialist. As Minister of Health, he battled the British Medical Association to implement a fair healthcare system. https://t.co/PyN4LuBCCDIf Biden is the nominee, the same people who stayed home in 2016 likely will stay home this year. Polls support that. 

If that upsets you, please note that the people you need to scold are not here. They can't afford to be on social media.

https://t.co/B2byMTI5SDBold actions like the ones Bernie has proposed on healthcare once looked risky. Now the risk is that we won’t implement them quickly enough.

There are already signs that people’s minds might be open to being changed in a way they weren’t just recently.

https://t.co/wyWYupMor3This fascinating article is both a reflection on our present-day situation -- covid, climate, fascism, etc. -- and a review of Connie Willis's science fiction. It does both very well.

https://t.co/H3xZAGDgAoHealth insurance industry stocks have jumped thanks to Biden’s recent success in the primary. It’s not surprising: Biden has promised to save their profits, while Sanders has said that healthcare financing should not be conducted by a for-profit industry. https://t.co/WCWlAMB7EiNancy Pelosi has made it clear that she will stand in the way of achieving single-payer healthcare.

https://t.co/qZF06zewh1Good article that, among other things, really hits home the point that Biden would have lost and lost big if the pandemic hadn't happened. https://t.co/svtbGD3sywWhen someone has a brush with some serious medical problem, the idea of losing them inevitably flickers into your mind. And when that happens, you realize what they really mean to you, b/c you can see for a second what the world would look like w/o them.  https://t.co/MuTeGqcGQb@cmclymer And how do you justify your employer doing this to a  WOC candidate? And your persistence of ignoring all my tweets because I happen to be Deaf makes you an Ableist &amp; Audist? But go ahead &amp; play the victim card as usual.

It was a great experience. Please just listen to me as I was a former Biden staff and what happened Thank you https://t.co/kxkBYYvJi7In 2010, Biden said of marijuana: “I still believe it’s a gateway drug… I think it would be a mistake to legalize.” He has since flip-flopped during this campaign over whether marijuana may be a gateway drug. https://t.co/WCWlAMB7EiIf Biden refuses to adopt popular policies that would help him get elected and which would also relieve an enormous amount of healthcare related suffering &amp; stress during a global health pandemic, any disaffected voters are Biden’s responsibility alone.

https://t.co/mw3y2i0ZOqBiden may squeak in, but he should have won in a landslide. Trump ran a horrible campaign, the economy is in recession, Covid has killed 230,000 people. People want progressive policies. How do you even come close to losing? Answer: by nominating Joe Biden https://t.co/eJBCF6i5lL@ParemQuern @jamesdpitley @morticia_harker @handleyzo @PepperOceanna @_taylorhudak @ninaturner @SilERabbit @Keyholder4u @dllynnnnn @WestCoastGadfly @MoarMeme @organicfanatic5 @AOC @sportgirlwillis It can be read here but the audio evidence is very compelling, clips of joe talking, arguing with warren on bankruptcy, his female accusers of inappropriate touching and more

I don't believe any democrat could vote for Joe after learning what lies within
