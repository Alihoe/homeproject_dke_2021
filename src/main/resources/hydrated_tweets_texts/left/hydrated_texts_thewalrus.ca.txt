https://t.co/Y0POXZSkpMThe pandemic has confused and exhausted teachers. Following physical distancing guidelines is difficult due to class sizes, and they are taking on double the workload as they stretch themselves to fill multiple roles.

To stop the spread of the disease, Russian physicians recommended burying alive anyone who started showing symptoms—which apparently did prove quite effective.” https://t.co/TAQ3l870wZThis strongly suggests the NDP might align with the CPC &amp; Bloc to force an election, using corruption as their grounds.
