https://t.co/ylylckAH0xSuch a great piece: 

‘To ask why more Africans aren’t dying of COVID-19 is to suggest that more Africans should be dying of COVID-19.
It exposes the expectation that when the world suffers, Africa must suffer more’ -@Nanjala1 

https://t.co/26AhH72dCR“”Why aren’t more Africans dying of COVID-19,’ like so many questions about Africa, fails to illuminate.“

@Nanjala1 reframes loaded words that too often go unexamined—“toll,” “success,” “cost,” “worse”—and shows us where our eurocentrism is showing.

https://t.co/jFWhMMSPBITo ask why #COVID_19 hasn't been deadlier in Africa is to suggest that more Africans should be dying. We need better questions. https://t.co/eTAddiS7NK"Useful questions set aside presumptions and biases about how the world must work and invite us to start imagining alternatives."

Brilliant read.

How to Talk about COVID-19 in Africa by @Nanjala1  https://t.co/id6kY1ZGn1@Nanjala1 has a special relationship with words...

https://t.co/Uykzcvp9T4.“Why aren’t more Africans dying of #COVID19?”

Almost every major news outlet has asked a variation of the question. But it suggests that more Africans *should* be dying—and exposes the expectation that when the world suffers, Africa must suffer more. https://t.co/N4xL2HiKVa“If useful questions avoid lazy and empty comparisons, then what should we be asking?
