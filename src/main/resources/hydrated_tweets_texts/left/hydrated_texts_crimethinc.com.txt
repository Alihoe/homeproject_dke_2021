Serbia: The Latest Front in the COVID-19 Riots

https://t.co/uGRhBUkjiH

Anarchists in Belgrade describe a week of riots involving rival political currents, describing their efforts to prevent fascists from dominating the unrest and liberals from delegitimizing it as "violent." https://t.co/X3FLrXdBEvCapitalism has always consumed the lives of workers for the sake of profits. #COVID19 just sped up the process. What used to take 50 years can now occur in a matter of weeks.

To treat this catastrophe, we don't just need a vaccine—we need a revolution.

Two posters—one with artwork by anarchist illustrator @NoBonzo promoting anti-eviction defense for the #RentStrike; another targeting COVID-19 profiteers.

They are only giving so much airtime to the Black Lives Matter movement because courageous people in Ferguson and Minneapolis stopped petitioning and broke the law.

https://t.co/qr7wAj0QHj https://t.co/75al1Wuczo https://t.co/9JtkFVtPVJFour years ago today, large and diverse anti-racist protests undermined a white power rally at Stone Mountain Park outside Atlanta. What was billed as a major white nationalist rally ended with just dozens trapped in a pen.

In 1884—despite a looming prison sentence—Errico Malatesta joined his comrades on a daring mission to Naples to treat a catastrophic outbreak of cholera.

#StaySafeOutThere  https://t.co/57LpD0CsOkWe support the striking Amazon, Instacart, and Whole Foods workers. Amazon is taking advantage of the pandemic to try to turn the entire US into a company town while treating service workers as expendable.

Fight back!

It's naive to beg the government to address the situation for us.

Both Democrats and Republicans will kill us to preserve capitalism.

https://t.co/A21ZRdwdmV https://t.co/CPpxcYCgWZBolsonaro catching #COVID19 after doing everything in his power to expose his countrymen to the virus is poetic justice. As in the Greek tragedies, every tyrant will pay for his hubris. The question is whether we will let them take us down with them.

The US government just allocated $1.5 trillion to prop up the stock market—$500 billion for the banks—but you still can't get tested for coronavirus.

They use every crisis as an opportunity to profit.

Resistance = life. https://t.co/t2sXFbPW2Vso you can get to know him. Then to get inspired &amp; informed here's an article that outlines amazing historical examples of rent strikes: https://t.co/EoYWQ3Ut8W  #COVID19 ...The prospect of quarantine tells us a lot about how we were already living https://t.co/njpxlGVcEN via @crimethincIt appears that Putin just agreed to support Erdoan in the ethnic cleansing of #Rojava. All the state powers—Turkey, the US, Russia, and Assad—unite against multi-ethnic self-determination. 

On one side, state tyranny. On the other, popular resistance.

In this amazing episode of our podcast, we speak with anarchist nurses around the United States about the crisis, harm reduction, how to support healthcare workers, and the meaning of health itself. https://t.co/Cb5k3F4zowSome things are worth risking death for. Perpetuating capitalism is not one of them. Going back to work—at risk of spreading #COVID19 or dying from it—so that the rich can continue accruing profits is not worth dying for.

https://t.co/r20u1F9kSv https://t.co/TCuiyTAKanHad Sanders won, it would have been just as disappointing to see the limitations of what he could accomplish through the state as it was to see the limits of the Democratic Party.

Housing costs were unsustainable long before the pandemic forced the issue. Reviewing a century of rent strikes to identify what makes them succeed or fail, we consider the prospects of this tactic today.

#RentStrike https://t.co/TxKLhbYMwmIf you're curious why demonstrators toppled statues of Lincoln and Roosevelt in Portland tonight, look up the Dakota 38 execution, the largest mass execution in US history. There's a lot to avenge.

https://t.co/9iljGeXp9Q

A collection of posters, stickers, and graffiti from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, Greece, Mexico, Slovenia, Spain, and the USA showing how anarchists and other rebels have responded to the #COVID19 pandemic. https://t.co/eqV5FbCyptWe must view Facebook's decision to ban anarchist pages in the context of the wave of demonstrations across the United States in response to police violence and the spread of #COVID19.

https://t.co/A3tBYQ8Bw0

This is not an effort to stop "violence," but to suppress protest. https://t.co/yqVVU353DVTrump's promise to ban all immigration is exactly sort of outright fascist activity what we warned that the pandemic would provide cover for (https://t.co/A21ZRdwdmV).

As before, we support all immigrants, documented or not (https://t.co/fj7trirTxP).

Smash the state.  https://t.co/N6EwOS6AA9On the eve of a Biden presidency, we must ask whether we can trust any government to prioritize our lives over the economy—and how to respond when they use the pretext of protecting us from #COVID19 to intensify control.

https://t.co/nYcbung7nJ

Against the virus and the state! https://t.co/AY2gfQhqwvWith #COVID19 spiking again in the US and in Brazil, it has never been clearer that supporters of Trump and Bolsonaro pose an immediate threat to our lives.

Nationalism and fascism are death cults that kill in many different ways—some overt, some not.
