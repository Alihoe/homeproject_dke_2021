#BlackLivesMatter #StopRacismSaveLives #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd https://t.co/seK0eidQnNWe had this in the can for a while, but it seemed trivial to discuss make-believe while real injustice is happening. 
Please support those who are fighting for their very lives by donating to charities like https://t.co/NSJGJqhDBd.

Full ep: https://t.co/x8NaFoxxnT https://t.co/uRcf6gIipRGeorge Floyd is only one of too many black lives taken like this. It’s been happening for decades because of a corrupt system that enables it. Black people have and are still trying to have their voices heard. Donate to support the #BLM cause.
