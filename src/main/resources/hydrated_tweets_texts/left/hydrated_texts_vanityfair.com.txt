https://t.co/DNCYFY3MaE https://t.co/bfHTVJLTAPInteresting coincidence: Jared Kushner’s secret plan for a nationwide response to the #coronavirus “went poof into thin air”— at about the same time his secret plan for Middle East peace did same.  https://t.co/9CUus2wWFNPeople are rightly talking about the revelation that Kushner was indifferent to Covid because he thought it was a blue state problem, but this is pretty shocking too

“The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” https://t.co/qK75aIIxutIt appears that both Trump and his s**t-in-law, Jared, believed that by making testing unavailable to Americans, the virus would hit liberal cities hardest, &amp; eliminate mostly Dems.

With no scientific understanding at all, they saw this as an opportunity.
