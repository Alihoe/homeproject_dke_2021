#NoBodyIsDisposableToday, I joined 800+ public health experts calling on Trump to drop the lawsuit trying to overturn the #ACA and take away health care from 20M Americans. Doing that anytime is bad; doing it during a pandemic is crazy. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/mL8d2bFG3T#TX23 is already one of the most medically underserved parts of Texas. Now, during a pandemic, President Trump and @KenPaxtonTX are working to gut the ACA and kick 2 million Texans off their insurance.

They don't give a damn about the health of Texans. https://t.co/nqkqChbKp2A new report shows that the pandemic could result in 3.4M more patients losing their health coverage if Republicans win their partisan health care lawsuit. These continued attacks—especially during a pandemic—are unconscionable.
