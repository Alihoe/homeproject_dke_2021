That's bad for science - especially for research on crises from the coronavirus to climate change. My latest for @newrepublic

A health care system designed to rake profits for an elite few is ill-suited to carrying out a nationwide herd immunity project. | The New Republic https://t.co/gyTEJ55Xu7A disturbing aspect of this moment is how big tech and big pharma are being recast as heroes and saviors when their mining and price gouging operations have shaped the miserable market dependency, pubic health disparity and incapacity at its root.
https://t.co/ckkwr4E8SsEven before the Covid-19 crisis hit, the restaurant industry was a risky business that relied on razor-thin margins and offered few protections for its workforce. https://t.co/UZb6tib8ajAs the coronavirus took hold in the U.S., @adamweinstein wrote about why we shouldn't use war rhetoric to describe our response to the crisis. https://t.co/umq3LvpA4L #MemorialDayTrump Is Cutting Food Stamps During a Pandemic https://t.co/l9ukj4YNYd"Pre-Covid, mid-Covid, and post-Covid, we are continually subject to death by law-enforcement fiat."

My article, "The Unmattering of Black Lives," in @newrepublic  https://t.co/z3eZVVUdcoThe 10 biggest Pharma corporations spent almost 170% of their net income on payments to shareholders and executives through stock buybacks and dividends in 2018. 

Pandemic or not, their shameless greed must end.

A sexual abuse survivor, beloved elder, and @survivepunishNY member. “She shouldn’t have even been [in prison] to begin with.”Trump's argument—that complying with subpoenas could hinder the pandemic response—is baseless for a very simple reason: Presidents do not “execute” or “enforce” federal law on a day-to-day basis. https://t.co/RwHZe8XY41COVID's "now being spread knowingly by our government into poor countries by way of our relentless deportation regime", because fock a poor country with POC, right?? 

Trump’s Deportation Flights Are Inflaming the Pandemic

https://t.co/lecYvcZM7v“Do you think that Covid-19 presents a grave threat to workers?” OSHA chief Loren Sweatt was asked yesterday at a congressional hearing. She declined to answer. In my latest, I explain why. https://t.co/8L433CmGBDToday is Miss Lulu’s birthday. She should be celebrating with family. She isn’t because @NYGovCuomo let her die in prison of COVID. He didn’t care that she survived a lifetime of abuse. He didn’t see her as fully human. RIP. #NoMoreDeaths #ClemencyNow https://t.co/vmp35ThkHWThese days, if you're buying gas, it doesn't cost more than $2. But, the U.S. military, which is buying fuel in bulk, is paying more than $10 a gallon in Iraq. My latest investigation gets into the corrupt networks allowing that to happen.

https://t.co/Qrvvzy50eBLong before they were ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic, our nursing homes were a place of heartlessness, abuse, and neglect, writes @libbycwatson. https://t.co/sdvMk3YXXUA warning from @SilvermanJacob:

"Don’t trust anyone who gets rich during a pandemic." 

 https://t.co/9QfSrnaIzxFor the president, the question isn't how many people die from the coronavirus pandemic, but who, writes @libbycwatson. https://t.co/mSD4e5c414GOP is desperately trying to get #COVID19 relief money in the hands of Big Oil

"Even though it would be unprecedented and dangerous for an oil and gas program to divert needed money from communities, there is really nothing from stopping that right now”

The New Republic https://t.co/q7izrKb7FoIt happened in 2005, and it’s happening now: “When a crisis disproportionately hurts those who are already structurally marginalized, the structural neglect of these factors further entrenches preexisting inequalities.”

My latest in @newrepublic... https://t.co/EbxldpafCh@KLGLASS2 No matter how liberal, most people who get rich and have lots of money forget notions of fairness and equality and think only about how to keep and make more money. That's what's happened to Zuckerberg. 
https://t.co/xtAgFD5l7IThe deaths of #AhmaudArbery and #BreonnaTaylor together represent what is widely understood within the African American community: that pre-COVID, mid-COVID, and post-COVID, we are continually subject to death by law-enforcement fiat.
