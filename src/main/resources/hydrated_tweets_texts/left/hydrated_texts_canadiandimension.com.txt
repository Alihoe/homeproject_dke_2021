In the current crisis context of ongoing genocide against Indigenous women &amp; girls, it is critically urgent to develop a gendered pandemic plan now. Read how Canada Is Ignoring the Gendered Impacts of #COVID19 on Indigenous Women by @Pam_Palmater https://t.co/5iHSOzrPJ9The High River Alberta Cargill meat plant plant is being reopened today.

Many meat plant workers live with long-term care facilities workers, where the explosive spread of #COVID19 has sickened and killed the most vulnerable. https://t.co/QQyogMu8eVhttps://t.co/dIFCv8F7Hq

https://t.co/kA4opTByqYJust as the success of the climate youth movement has been attributed to the clarity and consistency of messaging, we need this same strategy with COVID-19. https://t.co/pqOx6gmqrhThe situation in Manitoba is developing in such a way that the province may soon become a case study in the disastrous effects of austerity policies on societies recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
https://t.co/67sm7eMOL9The verdict is in: not only have Ford and his PC government not stepped up during the pandemic, but their response to the crisis has been delayed, negligent, and ineffectual.

https://t.co/YHpcrq4Dkj https://t.co/YCsDjJeEhNWe must struggle to ensure such killings never happens again, by abolishing the police and replacing it with truly life-sustaining services that build a better world for all.

 https://t.co/aOT15YbTDK"If we want to build a better Canada out of the ashes of this crisis—and if we want to address glaring omissions in our social safety net like pharmacare and dental care—then asking the very wealthiest to pay their fair share is a logical starting point."

Post #COVID19 a united and invigorated call for abolition and deinstitutionalization is more urgent than ever.

My latest piece for @CDN_Dimension. #Workers and communities under attack will make a big mistake if the rely on #Trudeau's fine words, empty promises and inadequate measures to protect them from the crisis unleashed by the #pandemicJean Chrétien’s austerity made Canada less prepared for COVID-19

In the 90's the Liberals made the largest ever cuts ever made to our social safety net. The cuts were big, cut deep and paved the way of the privatization of public services.

https://t.co/7q2LL3plDXLONG before #covid19 #pandemic Canada was in midst of human rights crisis. @MMIWG found Canada guilty of both historic &amp; ongoing genocide against Indigenous women &amp; girls. Very little substantive action taken since the report. #May5th #MMIWG @JustinTrudeau https://t.co/5dfQsFqMBCTo understand what makes people vulnerable in a pandemic, then, it is crucial that we look beyond individual health characteristics and towards the deep contradictions that structure these crises. https://t.co/0nkZw81h9w‘We Have Always Been Disposable’: the Structural Violence of Neoliberal Healthcare.

#cdnpoli #Socialism #JustinTrudeauGovernments' response to #COVID19 is blatantly aloof to the impacts of privatization which have systematically disadvantaged disabled populations for years. https://t.co/xENHSxiyfWYour regular reminder that the deepest spending cuts in Canadian history — to healthcare, housing, employment insurance and other social programs —  were made by a Liberal government https://t.co/vg3XzeG5Za #cdnpoli #covid19Doug Ford has been praised for his response to #COVID19, but his “hands-off-the-market” approach is simply a continuation of neoliberal, small-government ideas of the Mike Harris era and his assault on the public sector, says @danjdarrah.
