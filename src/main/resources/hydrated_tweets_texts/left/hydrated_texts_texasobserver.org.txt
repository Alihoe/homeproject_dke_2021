Texans are being evicted. 

What is @GovAbbott doing? Saying that DR.Fauci's assessment of the Coronavirus is wrong.

https://t.co/I0aBBE5PVhContinuing flights have formed a detention-to-deportation pipeline that has spread #COVID-19 through already vulnerable deportees, contributing to a crash in Guatemala’s healthcare system and sparking violence in many communities. https://t.co/laheX2dIFwJanio was deported to Guatemala without knowing if he might spread COVID-19 to his family and community. He's one of many Guatemalans deported during the pandemic, sparking violent clashes and overwhelming hospitals.

ICYMI here's my latest with @wmorena: https://t.co/E6FvpH72YZThe COVID-19 pandemic has turned telehealth into a necessity.

https://t.co/DRYl38T1fZThis is the San Antonio man deputies killed during a mental health crisis this week.

Six months into the pandemic, this is our collective effort to tell the stories behind the numbers. COVID-19 has deeply altered Texans' lives in infinite ways, but I'm struck by what these have in common. From Sept/Oct issue: https://t.co/kO35fQovTDWhen Lina Hidalgo was elected Harris County judge, many scoffed at her unexpected victory. Now she’s gained national fame for her hard stance on the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Read our 2019 profile of Hidalgo: https://t.co/AHXZLXydXFEvery year for eight years, Marco traveled 1,200 miles from Guanajuato, Mexico to Dalhart, Texas to harvest potatoes.

This year, after laboring without PPE and being told by bosses he was not allowed to return home, Marco died, alone, of Covid.

https://t.co/WQ8TEvJWSjMore than 5,000 people in ICE detention centers across the U.S. have contracted COVID-19 and there are more than 600 active cases
https://t.co/sJwsJbuxipFor eight years, Marco Antonio Galvan Gomez made an annual trip to Dalhart to work at Larsen Farms, one of the biggest potato producers in the nation. 

He died of COVID-19 complications this summer—and his family and federal investigators want answers.
https://t.co/vYliTVZuicICE refused to act as COVID spread, not even allowing immigrants to follow public health guidelines.

That led to thousands getting sick.

That led to deaths.

We must take action. Pass my FIRST Act to begin releasing immigrants from detention centers.

The digital divide is a life and death injustice. Families should not be forced to choose between education and health. https://t.co/xeHeiQ8PixThe majority of rural Texans don't have access to quality broadband internet.

From @TexasObserver. https://t.co/C3xuJLGdql"Texas could be making a difference by ending flaring," writes @amalahmed214, "but there’s little chance of that happening under Jim Wright's watch," who downplays flaring's harms. Good thing this article is packed with links he can read!

https://t.co/awElajCgT5Texas, which has the highest rate and number of uninsured residents, was woefully unprepared for the pandemic. For all the shortcomings COVID-19 has exposed in the U.S. health system, the failures are especially pronounced here.

I am running out of ways to say things are very bad and getting worse and state leaders are doing little to stop it, but that's where we are. How we got here: https://t.co/sYrGjLh7qt https://t.co/uwHWc3fk7YMillions of renters in the U.S. are facing eviction amid the pandemic.

"A future landlord can see that a tenant was sued for eviction and use that as a basis to deny their application."
