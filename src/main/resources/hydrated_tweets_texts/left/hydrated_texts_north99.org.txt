Walkerton and SARS both resulted in public inquiries. The COVID-19 crisis in long-term care homes is much larger, yet no public inquiry?

https://t.co/EGxS4AYe1HWould today be a good day to remind all
Canadians that Andrew Scheer couldn't grasp his lack of judgment when he thought it was a good idea to appear on Rebel Media countless times. Faith Goldy fully endorsed and shared his views on gun control.
https://t.co/WAFFkYJrKZRight now Canadian doctors and scientists are under attack by right-wing trolls using the same tactics as Donald Trump. Sign the Petition: Stand with Dr. Tam, our doctors and our scientists  https://t.co/b6eDdG2nGW #Istandwithtam  #COVID19"Andrew Scheer is in the final stages of a long con in which Canadian voters are the mark. Can an extremist be smuggled into power, passing himself off as ordinary, just by being incredibly boring? That appears to be the bet the Conservatives are making."

Don't let conservatives make this about deficits. #cdpoli

https://t.co/K9CJ1Lf5A0“Other examples, from Australia to Germany, show that parallel private-public healthcare systems do not decrease wait-times. In fact, they actually increase wait-times for most people who cannot afford to pay for private care.” https://t.co/ABo0VuaDQKIf Carpay’s “Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms” (JCCF) is in fact helping to fund this #spreadneck parade, then it makes sense to look at who funds them....

https://t.co/VFXnCK4FKLRich tax cheats are costing us $15 billion /year — enough to fund universal pharmacare https://t.co/IWIMugdL1jThanks @wearenorth99 for giving @OntLiberal leadership candidates the opportunity to answer questions on important issues including pharmacare, publicly-funded dental care, climate change, the economy and public housing. Read my responses: https://t.co/c4G70ApW0x #onpoli #olpldrThis is not the time for austerity. https://t.co/yZ9cwoiGfC #covid19canada #covid19 #cdnpoli@KathrynMathias1 @fstenson He also defended FIPA, Harper's deal which gave away some of our sovereignty to China. 

And now he's gaslighting pretending like he was always tough on China. 

It's the standard conservative grift. Just lie and hope people are dumb enough to believe it.

#HealthCanada takes the time to test thoroughly before approval.  

#COVID19 #abpoliCanada's public services like healthcare and education are radically underfunded compared to other developed countries. https://t.co/oNDmbi7kOEI was pleased to answer @wearenorth99’s questions about pharma and dental care, fighting climate change, growing the economy in an inclusive way and housing.

Jason Kenney made private healthcare a part of his policies.  Private healthcare costs more than public healthcare and is slower/gives worse service!  You become a client instead of a patient.  Go to the USA if you want private care, @jkenneyFord spent last summer cooped up, so this summer he’s hitting the campaign trail. Meanwhile, the pandemic rages on #onpoli https://t.co/p0yOxqbe8cKenney expanding private, for-profit healthcare to cut wait-times, but the evidence shows privatization does the exact opposite https://t.co/tKSwm6hkpQI just emailed the government calling on them to crack down on banks profiting off COVID-19. Join me in speaking out:  https://t.co/YSv07zwTCNNo wonder Scheer won't sanction Sloan.The whole fucking party is racist.

"Over 25% of Conservative MPs Have Appeared on Rebel Media"

"Here’s a list of the many times Andrew Scheer &amp; his Conservatives embraced racism or were connected to racist groups."
