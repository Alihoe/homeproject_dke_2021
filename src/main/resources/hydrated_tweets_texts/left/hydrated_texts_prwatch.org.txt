In opposing Medicaid expansion, Koch-funded organizations have increased the likelihood of the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. https://t.co/W9X5XTEzNv“Koch-funded groups like ALEC are lobbying hard to block any relief from the federal gov. Koch-backed groups appear to be taking advantage of the crisis to advance their ideological goals &amp; further undermine public education and public employee unions.” https://t.co/CPX4cyrGPcAside from lobbying against the #HeroesAct &amp; legal protections for employee and customer safety, ALEC is also exploiting the pandemic to gerrymander our districts, privatize our public schools &amp; curb federal #COVID19 emergency response. https://t.co/QTyPqGti5OState races are also key to the GOP’s long-standing desire to convene an Article V Convention of States to re-write the US Constitution. Don’t let it happen. Vote your full ballot &amp; confirm those races aren’t missing or flipped on the printout. 6/ https://t.co/zL3G35ttMFKoch Group Pushing for Employer Immunity Takes $3.5M From Company with COVID-19 Outbreaks
