4. Trump is already spending $1.5 MILLION PER WEEK on Facebook. 

What happens on Facebook was important in 2016 could be decisive in 2020. 

It deserves scrutiny.

If you value this kind of accountability journalism, sign up for my newsletter  https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZFacebook accused my former employer, @KTOOpubmedia, of posting clickbait, then throttled its ability to reach its 11,000 followers. Good @JuddLegum piece on what happened when the station tried to contact Facebook to fix the social media company's mistake: https://t.co/pLE7fzBEm0@KTOOpubmedia 3. David Purdy, who works in KTOO's 9-person newsroom, thought this was a mistake. So he clicked a link to appeal Facebook's decision

In a few days, the ruling came back

KTOO lost the appeal &amp; now the entire page would get reduced distribution for 2 wks

https://t.co/YGkBJecalB https://t.co/jKJqpPhY2AThere is only one reason this attack is happening now: Because Trump set the stage by relocating US troops at Ergodan’s request 

It was not inevitable. It was a policy decision by Trump

My reporting found that policy is set by Republican operatives in DC who are obsessed with appeasing Trump https://t.co/5mBoi8301s1. Can we talk about what's happened over the last week?

Because the entire Republican Party was caught with their pants down

And now they are just pretending like it didn't happen

https://t.co/FW0xQa7llW3. Facebook's rules explicitly prohibit "coordinated inauthentic behavior" which it defines as "groups of accounts and Pages working together to mislead people about who they are and what they’re doing."

That's exactly what's happening here 

https://t.co/Rdhzbt4V4B6. I can't make Facebook enforce its own rules, but I can make sure people know how this $500 billion company operates.

At the moment, it's bending over backwards to appease the far right

If you value this work, please sign up for my newsletter  https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ"Popular Information has uncovered a network of 14 large Facebook pages that exclusively promote content from The Daily Wire. None of the pages reveal their connection to The Daily Wire, and many purport to be independent media outlets." https://t.co/phn1w0vO9KPlease support @JuddLegum’s groundbreaking work with https://t.co/J9d6k2SXpt if you can. He’s uncovering stories on his own that rival any large journalistic organization’s stories. https://t.co/U9x1ACRqe81. The Trump campaign has held 15 contests since 2018 offering the chance to win breakfast, lunch, or dinner with President Trump. 

An investigation by Popular Information did not uncover evidence that anyone has ever actually won

https://t.co/Icp8qF2Fyp"The Trump campaign has held at least 15 contests since 2018 offering the chance to win breakfast, lunch, or dinner with President Trump...An investigation by Popular Information, however, did not uncover evidence that anyone has ever actually won." https://t.co/Pkc46Vo8GJ5. Facebook did not respond to a question about whether it consulted with the employees who were upset by Kaplan's appearance last year before agreeing to sponsor this event. 

Facebook did tell me, after I asked, that Kaplan wasn't attending the dinner

https://t.co/amtwSyaLCw2. Facebook told me that, in November, it would require pages, like those in The Daily Wire astroturf network, to disclose what entity is actually managing them. 

That has not happened. 

https://t.co/z5s3LsOMm3 https://t.co/DL3EK7qxcSCan you imagine what would have happened if Obama collected millions in donations for a chance to win a meal with him and then didn't show up?

But this hasn't been a major story to this point because we've created a separate set of rules for Trump 

https://t.co/2de4xHOcCHProPublica has a damning story about McKinsey's work with ICE 

https://t.co/omivMaW1MF

BUT McKinsey STOPPED working for ICE in 2018

But @Deloitte CONTINUES to work with ICE 

Deloitte has inked $188 MILLION in contracts with ICE since Trump took office

https://t.co/xqUt9nWx4M1. The fact that no Republican currently supports impeachment does not reflect a failure of the Democrats to uncover clearly impeachable acts 

What the Democrats have uncovered is STUNNING

It reflects the Republicans total imperviousness to facts

https://t.co/y7AzDh5r3c2. It is particularly impressive that the Democrats were able to uncover so much despite an unprecedented effort by Trump to obstruct the impeachment investigation

The administration ignored 71 records requests and 12 witnesses refused to testify 

 https://t.co/y7AzDh5r3cBlood money by @JuddLegum https://t.co/exOsPZOdBG.            ‘We feel confident that both the king as well as mbs will commit to uncovering the facts surrounding these disturbing occurrences’. In the mean time who do we make the check out to?4. And here's the kicker: This is happening because Trump cut the tax rate from 35% (which no one paid) to 21% without closing any of the loopholes. 

Trump says that, if he's reelected, he will CUT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE AGAIN

https://t.co/zCY4fZqbalThe rich and corporations are already on a tax strike.

This is why we are in debt.

Public funding gets cut and costs shift to individuals who are in turn forced into debt to meet basic needs like healthcare/housing/education.
https://t.co/YuLOdpJ3I01. Something important happened on the way to impeachment that was basically ignored

On 10/22, GOP Leader McCarthy said we should LISTEN TO THE DIPLOMATS about QUID PRO QUO

In other words, if diplomats said there was a quid pro quo this would be serious

https://t.co/9jH5394QWu https://t.co/8ufDG132k04. So

The top House Republican set a criteria. Trump's actions would be serious misconduct if "the diplomats" said there was a "quid pro quo"

Then "the diplomats" testified there was a "quid pro quo"

And McCarthy and the GOP pretended it never happened

https://t.co/9jH5394QWuThis isn't a small problem. The Trump campaign has spent more that $650,000 in the last 7 days on ads like this. 

What happens online could determine the outcome in 2020.

https://t.co/TfpCItdVSoOn Sunday, I reported that former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared on Meet The Press without disclosing that he was a director at defense contractor Lockheed Martin

On Monday, Johnson appeared on CNN, which made the disclosure

Journalism matters

https://t.co/zHLZMYbHPj https://t.co/tJHt86yfHD2. Joe Lieberman appeared on Fox News on January 6 praising Trump for ordering the strike. 

He was introduced as the former Democratic VP nominee. 

NOT DISCLOSED: Lieberman works for an Israeli weapons manufacturer looking to expand sales to the DoD

https://t.co/AANvoO6ZP03. William Cohen appeared on CNN on January 5. He was identified as the “former secretary of defense.”

NOT DISCLOSED: Cohen runs a consulting firm which “has assisted [defense] clients to compete for and win tens of billions of dollars in contracts.”

https://t.co/AANvoO6ZP04. Michael Chertoff appeared on CNN on January 7, identified as the “former Homeland Security Secretary"

Chertoff defended Trump’s legal authority to conduct the strike

NOT DISCLOSED: Chertoff is the chairman of BAE Systems, a major weapons manufacturer

https://t.co/AANvoO6ZP06. Dave Deptula appeared on CNN on Jan 4. He was identified as a former “Air Force Lieutenant.” 

He said Trump acted with "incredible restraint."

Deptula is the Dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, which is funded by defense contractors

https://t.co/AANvoO6ZP07. John Negroponte appeared on Fox on Jan 3. He was identified as “the former US ambassador to Iraq"

He praised Trump for killing Soleimani

NOT DISCLOSED: Negroponte is Vice-Chair of McLarty Associates, a lobbying firm representing the defense industry

https://t.co/AANvoO6ZP02. In response, Google told https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ it doesn't consider all climate disinfo to be "harmful"

For example, it considers climate misinformation clipped from Fox News to be part of a legit public discourse on a political &amp; scientific issue

https://t.co/5gGwbxICHN9. Look, it's not 1992. Online ads are a big deal. They could determine the outcome of the 2020 election

That's why I'm spending time on this. The only way anything happens is with intense public scrutiny

Stay informed by subscribing to my newsletter  https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo1. The coronavirus is killing thousands &amp; threatening to tank the global economy

But in India today, Trump is downplaying the threat

Two years ago, Trump fired the government’s entire pandemic response team &amp; didn't replace them

Let's review THE FACTS

https://t.co/zYWOlMrC0S2. In 2018, Trump ousted Tim Ziemer, the Senior Director of Global Health Security. Ziemer was on the NSC, where he was responsible for coordinating "responses to global health emergencies and potential pandemics."

https://t.co/zYWOlMrC0S3. Ziemer was lauded as "one of the most quietly effective leaders in public health." He was not replaced. 

"Admiral Ziemer’s departure is deeply alarming. Expertise like his is critical in avoiding large outbreaks" -- @RepBera, 2018

https://t.co/zYWOlMrC0S5. In addition to firing experts, Trump also slashed funding for the CDC's epidemic prevention activities, forcing the agency to end its work in 39 out of 49 countries.

One of the countries where the CDC had to end its work?

China.

https://t.co/zYWOlMrC0S6. Trump has removed the experts and now it's unclear who is in charge

The CDC said it was too dangerous to send Americans who were infected w/coronavirus on a plane w/others who weren't infected

But the White House overruled them and it happened anyway

https://t.co/zYWOlMrC0SSIMPLE QUESTION: Who is in charge of the United States response to the coronavirus?

I'll wait.

https://t.co/zYWOlMrC0S1. This New York Post column is one of the most widely shared pieces about the coronavirus.

It has been shared 80K times on Facebook and 8K times on Twitter. 

It has been promoted by a US Senator.

And it's complete quackery.

https://t.co/5zVEbdMpKs https://t.co/jOrgRdIOY65. Experts who have examined the genome sequence of the coronavirus say it is completely inconsistent with a bioweapon. This is a fantasy invented by Mosher. 

But that didn't stop his piece from being shared by U.S. Senator @TomCottonAR 

https://t.co/5zVEbe4192 https://t.co/nWkl1Uvfbi"Time for a quick reality check. Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill" -- Mike Pence, 2000

More on coronavirus and misinformation from Trump and his allies in my newsletter, Popular Information. 

Sign up --&gt; https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo1. Twitter and Facebook have made a big show about cracking down on coronavirus misinformation but a dangerous conspiracy theory about the CDC is spreading rapidly on both platforms. 

https://t.co/045wXO6hfg2. Right-wing media is suggesting Americans ignore warnings from the CDC because a top expert, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, is the sister of Rod Rosenstein. Supposedly she is part of a deep state plot to take down Trump

Messonnier has worked at CDC for 25 years

https://t.co/045wXO6hfg2. On Friday, Politico published an article headlined "Trump rallies his base to treat coronavirus as a ‘hoax.’"

The Daily Caller declared this was "false information." If you try to post the article to Facebook, this is what you see. 

https://t.co/AoMU8uhDR8 https://t.co/aDS4Ogpo1y3. The Daily Caller's fact check claims that Trump referred only to the Democrats' politicization of the coronavirus as a "hoax"

But that's not what Trump said

He said: "This is their new hoax"

The Daily Caller resolves that ambiguity in favor of Trump

https://t.co/AoMU8uhDR84. The Daily Caller justifies its ruling by claiming: "Throughout the speech, Trump reiterates his administration is taking the threat of the coronavirus seriously"

Throughout the speech, Trump minimizes the threat of the coronavirus

Read it yourself

https://t.co/AoMU8uhDR8 https://t.co/4aebHW0P6fUPDATE: The Daily Caller has also labeled a NBC News article, which isn't even discussed in its fact check, as "false information. 

The headline is "Trump calls coronavirus Democrats' 'new hoax'" 

This is what happens when you try to post it on Facebook

https://t.co/AoMU8uhDR8 https://t.co/XT1hSC6igoREMINDER: Trump fired the US pandemic response team in 2018, then eliminated their positions https://t.co/ftbQJ57PnL5. As coronavirus spreads, @darden is lobbying the Florida legislature to pass a preemption bill that would prevent Florida cities from requiring paid sick leave 

It successfully lobbied for a similar law in North Carolina in 2016 

https://t.co/z8Wa6pKEJ96. The gov't has a central role in the coronavirus response. 

But corporations also have a deep responsibility to take action to limit community spread.

Pure incompetence

https://t.co/LSp7ORU7QqWOW.

Trump is finally confronted with the fact that he fired the US pandemic response team in 2018

Trump first says its a "nasty question" and then says he DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT

Here are the facts: https://t.co/LSp7ORU7Qq https://t.co/xvagpXPK865. I first contacted @kroger three days ago, and they never got back to me. But today, Kroger's CEO announced that TWO KROGER EMPLOYEES TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19. 

https://t.co/19uNybbSiL6. Despite an outbreak within its own workforce, @kroger will still not provide paid sick leave. Instead, it will provide two weeks paid sick leave ONLY to employees that: 1. Test positive for COVID-19, and 2. Are formally ordered to be quarantined

https://t.co/19uNybttHl.@kroger is the largest supermarket chain in the US.

It has 453K employees and many receive no sick leave.

Even after 2 employees tested positive for COVID-19, @kroger still won't provide paid sick leave to everyone

https://t.co/19uNybttHlTo stop the spread of the coronavirus, personal responsibility won't be enough. We also need CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

https://t.co/LSp7ORU7Qq1. @amazon had more than $280 billion in revenue in 2019

Since the pandemic, its business is booming. 

BUT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF IT'S EMPLOYEES DO NOT RECEIVE ANY PAID SICK LEAVE

This is particularly true of part-timers and contract workers

https://t.co/KQEpWXm8Tn4. Amazon is paying for 2 weeks leave only for people diagnosed with COVID-19 or ordered into quarantine. 

This won't help most. There are few tests, and people will not receive orders. They need to be empowered to protect themselves and others. 

https://t.co/KQEpWXm8TnKroger ($KR) the largest supermarket chain in the country, does not offer paid employee sick leave. 

Asymptomatic Covid-19 infected employees may be handling food for millions of people. Imagine the results if they become a proven contagion vector.

https://t.co/hSuuLDMxL41. .@kroger refuses to give paid sick leave to all of its employees — even though they are on the front lines of this pandemic.

Instead, everyone gets a $25 Kroger gift card.

And they are attacking me for reporting the facts.

https://t.co/S4nhZP3ufo4. I'm going to continue to tell the truth about how @Kroger and other large companies are responding to the pandemic. 

They don't like it, but this moment demands PUBLIC SCRUTINY and ACCOUTABILITY.

Join this effort by signing up for my newsletter --&gt; https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo5. @kroger is making A LOT OF MONEY from the pandemic. I spoke to an employee at a Kroger store in Kentucky yesterday who told me the store they work at made 2x AS MUCH MONEY LAST WEEK AS THE WEEK OF THANKSGIVING, typically the biggest week of the year 

https://t.co/zsktJ5GiDh3. Why? COVID-19 tests are still incredibly hard to come by. 

And govt's aren't formally placing many people in quarantines. They are asking them to self-quarantine based on guidance.

https://t.co/4tUEG7rvni6. I'm going to continue to subject the actions of large corporations, especially those that are profiting from the pandemic, to PUBLIC SCRUTINY.

In the absence of comprehensive action from Congress, this is the best tool we have.

Join this effort --&gt; https://t.co/TfpCItdVSoBREAKING: After a week of pressure, @Kroger has significantly expanded its paid sick leave policy. 

It now will offer two weeks of paid sick leave to anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or who place themselves into isolation

https://t.co/zsktJ5GiDh https://t.co/NLphs3C2TjSUNDAY: I reported @Kroger doesn't provide sick leave to many workers and will only pay workers that test positive for COVID-19 or get a quarantine order

TUES: Kroger gave workers a $25 gift card &amp; attacked my reporting

TODAY: Kroger changed its policy

https://t.co/wBCH7pbw643. A call script obtained by https://t.co/JhoV1QDaTS says customer service representatives in the New York area "must not speculate on additional precautions technicians may or may not take (e.g., wear masks or gloves)."

https://t.co/LZQpH8YaJn1. Amazon, owned by the richest man in the world, is soliciting PUBLIC DONATIONS to pay sick leave for contract drivers who contract COVID-19

This is not a joke

https://t.co/YAYeLo5Jak2. Amazon has one of the worst policies for workers who contract COVID-19. Requires a positive test or a formal quarantine order to get paid. 

But contractors have it even worse. They have to apply for a "grant" from the Amazon Relief Fund.

https://t.co/YAYeLo5Jak6. As a result of the pandemic, Amazon's business is booming. It is likely to permanently benefit from this crisis. The absolute least it can do is take care of the workers that make its service possible. 

https://t.co/YAYeLo5Jak7. UPDATE: Amazon has responded and they say that it is COMPLETELY NORMAL for a company with $281 billion of revenue last year to require workers who contract a potentially-deadly virus to APPLY FOR A GRANT to get paid while they are quarantined. 

https://t.co/YAYeLo5Jak https://t.co/Uy8CGaRniK‘Amazon owned by the richest person in the world, is soliciting donations to pay for workers' sick leave? Why isn't Amazon just paying people who contracted #COVID19 while doing essential work for them?’ https://t.co/kMWX5ldLUj1. For millions, the most convenient place to get supplies during the pandemic isn't a supermarket but @DollarGeneral 

I obtained the company's COVID-19 sick leave policy and it's bad

Worse, almost everyone who works @DollarGeneral has never heard of it

https://t.co/flP82JLwps@DollarGeneral 2. Except where required by law, @DollarGeneral does not normally provide paid sick leave 

During the pandemic it will pay workers for two weeks only if they (or a member of their household) test positive 

https://t.co/flP82JLwps@DollarGeneral 4. I connected with 14 @DollarGeneral workers and only one had heard anything about special paid sick leave policies for COVID-19. 

Many shared stories about working in the store during a pandemic. 

This one was a gut punch. 

https://t.co/flP82JLwps https://t.co/oi0RIBmoq5.@DollarGeneral is not as high profile as @Amazon or @kroger. But for millions of Americans it is the most important source of supplies during the pandemic.

Its business is BOOMING.

But its paid sick leave policy puts its workers and customers at risk.

https://t.co/flP82JLwpsA majority of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to polls

How many Americans know that he dismantled the pandemic response team, the people with the expertise to respond to this kind of crisis, in 2018?

https://t.co/ftbQJ57PnL@DollarGeneral .@DollarGeneral is encouraging workers with "indirect exposure" to COVID-19 to report to work, as long as they don't have symptoms. 

But COVID-19 spreads asymptomatically.

The company won't answer questions about what qualifies as "indirect exposure"

https://t.co/flP82JLwps https://t.co/UWHVEVdhxrThere will be a lot of time to detail Trump's handling of this pandemic, which will go down in history as one of the greatest failures in USA history

The more immediate concern is bringing public scrutiny to conditions of front line workers

Join in --&gt; https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo1. @UPS had $74 billion in revenue last year. 

On its website, UPS claims it's taking a series of steps to protect the health of employees during the pandemic

But DOZENS of UPS workers say those things aren't happening. 

https://t.co/Ld0tjvY7sN@UPS 2. For example, UPS says its providing drivers with "sanitizing supplies." 

A Virginia UPS driver says they have been provided with "nothing" and "bought myself hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes"

Another UPS driver in the western US says the same thing

https://t.co/Ld0tjvY7sN https://t.co/dQPMZFaRtR4. The population most vulnerable to COVID-19, older Americans, also tilts Republican. 

If voters over 65 don't show up to vote in Florida, for example, that could be catastrophic for Trump.

https://t.co/z8Wa6pKEJ9If you are wondering why we have a lagging infrastructure to combat the #COVID19 pandemic, it is because Trump fired the NSC's Global Health Security team in 2018 and never replaced them. Sharing this @JuddLegum piece more than once and highlight key lines https://t.co/C33dAgBnCMIn 2018, Trump fired the entire US pandemic response team that Obama put in place.

No. 

He simply had other priorities.

https://t.co/X8KMPVGYKv6. In an impassioned letter to his employees, @CapitalOne's CEO praised his company's compassionate response to the pandemic.

But Capital One is a member of the @USChamber and the company has had no response to the Chamber's lobbying campaign 

https://t.co/X8KMPVGYKvWe are one team. And our team needs more ventilators, masks, and tests. What does @Nike think about the @USChamber lobbying (on Nike's behalf) against using the Defense Production Act?

Thousands are dying as a result of their failures. 

And hold corporations accountable for how they treat workers who can’t stay home.

I wanted to find out what it was like to make and deliver pizza for these companies during a pandemic.

It's not pretty. 

https://t.co/4CBOsIT1mj2. Out of 52 drivers, cooks, and managers I spoke to at the 3 companies, just one reported receiving a mask. 

A handful said they were provided gloves or sanitizer. 

The vast majority received no protective equipment.

But @PetSmart JUST REOPENED ITS DOG GROOMING SALONS

I obtained the internal guidance for Petsmart staff.

And it's breathtaking.

https://t.co/SuR2BhZyb5@PetSmart 2. The internal guidance says employees should accept pets from people WHO SAYS THEY ARE COVID-19 POSITIVE or who show up with symptoms. 

They should groom the pet with PPE

What if PPE are unavailable? Groom the pet anyway and just don't touch your face

https://t.co/SuR2BhZyb5@PetSmart 3. Petsmart also recognizes that groomers will need to violate social distancing guidelines

For example, groomers may need to help each other lift large dogs onto a table

But Petsmart says they can maintain distance by lifting OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE DOG

https://t.co/SuR2BhZyb5 https://t.co/qSLqTXw3vd10. @Petco is also offering dog grooming services during the pandemic. They never stopped. And unlike @Petsmart, @Petco is keeping their LA locations open.

This is a big part of the reason/problem. 

How private equity is using the pandemic to extort taxpayers  by @JuddLegum https://t.co/IKhAmVMW0p1. Millions of Americans are putting their lives at risk to serve others.

It worked

The private equity firm is now getting paid $8 million from taxpayers

It appears the $20M will be spent paying managers &amp; executives

https://t.co/nDAhzjAnvq1. One very strange thing about the anti-quarantine protests is that none of the protesters are protesting Trump. 

Trump has issued federal guidelines recommending a national quarantine through May 1 and, in most states, for many weeks after that

https://t.co/MltKp14fXI2. Instead of protesting Trump, the protesters are wearing MAGA hats. 

Why?

These protests really aren't about protesting the quarantine orders.

They are about getting Trump reelected

https://t.co/MltKp14fXIDon’t praise @RuthsChris for returning $20 million of #SmallBusiness money they shouldn’t have gotten - they’ve furloughed nearly every worker, kept upper management on full pay, had massive lines of credit &amp; blew their surpluses on stock buybacks https://t.co/eyZZd8B5ExCorona cute: 32 companies paid their CEOs millions while collecting taxpayer money intended for struggling small businesses.

He's going to give himself another bonus of $585,233 "no later than December 31, 2020"

In 2019, his total compensation was $5.6 MILLION 

https://t.co/LBu8LX2pcY5. Will these funds sent to Monty Bennett be used to pay hotel employees?

It doesn't appear that way. 

The company says it does not believe it will qualify for loan forgiveness. That suggests the bulk of the money will not be spent on payroll. 

https://t.co/LBu8LX2pcYA big question that Monty Bennett (multi-millionaire Trump donor) needs to answer is: Where is his $100 million in small business loans going?

He doesn't appear to be rehiring staff or paying creditors. 

https://t.co/LBu8LXk04wThe pandemic is a story about class

White collar workers are told to "stay safe at home" while grocery workers and meat packers are forced to expose themselves to the virus without protections

More in my newsletter --&gt; https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo4. The justification for this order - keeping meatpacking plants open is necessary to prevent disruption in "the supply of protein" - is ridiculous

https://t.co/pnFFL20hrzJust a reminder that Trump's campaign manager pushed  hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment based on a fringe medical group that also claimed Obama hypnotized Jews

New data shows it doesn't work and the FDA has withdrawn its emergency use authorization

https://t.co/z3VtWojm84 https://t.co/gJnfKpNGkLThe Trump administration has also just sent millions of doses of this ineffective treatment to Brazil 

Brazil has the second most COVID-19 cases in the world, behind the US

Both countries have leaders that ignore science

https://t.co/z3VtWojm84Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, always looking for an opportunity to ingratiate himself with Trump, purchased 2 MILLION DOSES of hydroxychloroquine for his state. 

1,980,000 doses remain unused because Florida hospitals don't want it. 

https://t.co/z3VtWojm84Trump said he recently told "his people" to slow down coronavirus testing

This is the original sin of the coronavirus response

Here is my report FROM MARCH 2 about how the CDC stopped reporting testing and LESS THAN 500 PEOPLE HAD BEEN TESTED IN THE US

https://t.co/Kx8Tjowxj1@samstein Yes. You're not following. Brad said 1 million tickets were reserved so they didn't do the usual outreach &amp; contests i.e. meet &amp; take photos w/ Trump. Attendees had to agree to coronavirus waivers with 1 million  reservations. Self preservation kicked in.

https://t.co/mEWiaf9mpc https://t.co/OfkkzyNA035. Let me stop here and say this is not how the fact-checking program is supposed to work. Facebook is supposed to have no role in the appeals process. That's why Facebook refers to the fact-checkers as "independent" 

https://t.co/bWWV2Jsvl16. Here's an example. On June 19, 2020, Mad World News wrote an article about a guy waiving a confederate flag on the side of the road who was threatened by a man with a gun. 

NOT MENTIONED: This incident happened in 2015

https://t.co/sZigsHU6x1 https://t.co/1bFcP5FDQy7. The undisclosed relationship between @benshapiro and Mad World News appears to violate Facebook's rules. You are required to disclose when you are posting content for money.

Facebook also bans "artificially boost[ing] the popularity of content."

https://t.co/sZigsHU6x1Facebook has a rule against posting misinformation about masks. 

It just won't enforce it.

https://t.co/2mNOvFqYPc5. The pandemic has impacted @Starbucks but nearly all its stores are now open and the company is projecting a substantial profit this year.

https://t.co/hKxE0IOmoDAmid new COVID surge, corporations keep wages flat for frontline workers by @JuddLegum https://t.co/O4935iuMEu1. If 95% of Americans wore masks, we could save 45,000 LIVES between now and November 1. 

But millions of Americans refuse to do so.

Why?

Trump plays a part.

But Facebook and YouTube are also part of the problem.

Let's review.

https://t.co/P32KHql06P2. Facebook policy bans claims that masks make you sick because the company says it "could lead to imminent harm."

But an Ohio politician posted on Facebook that masks "drop oxygen below danger levels in 5 seconds"

It quickly was shared 13K times

https://t.co/P32KHql06P3. Facebook removed the post after I contacted the company. 

But it did not remove a post by the same politician that claimed "there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing masks actually do harm." 

Facebook says that's not specific enough to remove

https://t.co/P32KHql06P7. There are so many lives at stake. We've become numb.

That's why included this overhead view of Nats stadium. 

The difference between wearing masks when you can't distance from others and not wearing masks is everyone in Nats stadium living or dying.

https://t.co/P32KHql06P https://t.co/RshZyfmo0mThere are over 62,000 new confirmed COVID-19 cases today, an all-time record

We can bring that number down, and save tens of thousands of lives, if there weren't millions of Americans who refuse to wear masks

YouTube &amp; Facebook are part of the problem 

https://t.co/P32KHql06PI reported on this guy last week. Facebook took down three posts I flagged that claimed wearing a mask would make you sick. But that apparently prompted no wider examination of his page. https://t.co/P32KHql06P https://t.co/aB2V61JCA5The Trump administration's approach to school reopening reflects its belief that it can skip planning and resource allocation and bully its way through the pandemic

https://t.co/RcL1gorpfs2. Trump's first move exercising these (fake) new powers happened yesterday, when he announced he could ignore the 2020 Census, invent his own numbers excluding undocumented immigrants, and use those made-up figures to apportion members of Congress

https://t.co/Arl7w70Ox51. A U.S. Congressman (@RepGrothman) is using his position to promote notorious coronavirus conspiracy theorist Judy Mikovits

As @Facebook spokesperson @andymstone told the New York Times https://t.co/tqxcztNK9L #ClimateAction #COVID194.

It's the same scheme @realDailyWire was using with a toxic group of Facebook pages controlled by Mad World News

THE TRUTH: he's proposing to protect corporations in virtually every circumstance, no matter how egregious the conduct

Let's review

https://t.co/LYiim5CVZr8. Since guidelines by the CDC are optional and not mandatory you can actually comply with CDC guidelines without doing anything at all. 

This seems like a pretty big loophole

https://t.co/LYiim5CVZr9. The bill also bars all COVID-19 injury cases from state court and moves them all into federal court which is a venue that is much friendlier to defendants 

https://t.co/LYiim5CVZr10. The bill, in other words, makes COVID-19 litigation something that would be unlikely to something that is virtually impossible

This would create an environment where businesses would have an incentive to cut corners to save money 

https://t.co/LYiim5CVZrWhat happened before Kodak's moment by @JuddLegum https://t.co/681xmU1BJg7. The loan was based on an executive order Trump signed in May to improve supply chains for COVID-19. It appears that this is part of a scheme to produce more hydrochloroquine domestically, a drug that hasn't proved effective in treating COVID-19

https://t.co/vv9bDycWawUPDATE: Apart from the shady stock transactions, an open Q regarding Kodak is WHY Trump decided to be so nice to them.

Why take a company that has been running on fumes for a decade and give them a massive loan to turn into a pharmaceutical company?

https://t.co/vv9bDycWaw5. Normally, you could argue execs should be rewarded for striking a deal that saves a company. But in this case it was a TAXPAYER loan intended to respond to a PANDEMIC.

Using that occasion to personally enrich topic execs takes on a different meaning

https://t.co/apAapzVQcu1. 6 of the top 25 COVID-19 clusters in the US are slaughterhouses

https://t.co/hKxE0IOmoD7. There really isn't any room to increase the number of Californians behind bars. The courts have said anything above 137.5% occupancy is unconstitutional. They are already right up to the line. And even that level is unsafe during a pandemic

https://t.co/wKqFj2KTsB1. Facebook took action against Sarah Palin's page after I uncovered evidence she was accepting money to post links, which is against Facebook's rules

If the deadline was extended, that couldn't happen until April 2021. Trump might not be in office

https://t.co/viKDi3SLpb4. Princeton Enterprises, a company with thousands of properties across 15 states, is aggressively eviciting tenants during a pandemic. 

But it has taken taxpayer money to support its own operation.

The company received a PPP loan of 350K to 1M in April

https://t.co/viKDi3SLpb1. 62 corporate landlords who have received taxpayer bailouts intended to blunt the economic impact of the pandemic are pursuing evictions despite a federal moratorium, a Popular Information investigation reveals

A Trump campaign official appeared on an online show devoted to QAnon and encouraged viewers to volunteer for the campaign. 

https://t.co/9oYE3Fb2tu1. There has been a lot of focus on the HYPOCRISY of the Senate focusing the next 6 weeks on Trump's SCOTUS nominee.

But that has obscured its CRUELTY

The Senate last passed COVID legislation 5 MONTHS AGO

Millions are suffering.

 https://t.co/ytqqrqCfnF1. The latest Project Veritas investigation on "ballot harvesting" is a combination of blatant misinformation and wild accusations with no factual support. 

But that hasn't stopped the its video from going viral on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube

https://t.co/7q4owHPIPpDisinformation about COVID-19 is DEADLY. But a trip to the hospital hasn't stopped Trump -- or his friends in the far-right media -- from spreading it. 

I'll have more in my newsletter, Popular Information. 

Sign up --&gt; https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo1. Yesterday, Breitbart published a completely false article to suggest that masks are ineffective

Facebook has a policy against COVID-19 misinfo that could create imminent harm

Breitbart's article is dangerous

But Facebook is giving them a pass

Again

https://t.co/cuMkbNsO8Z2. The Breitbart article claimed that Senator Thom Tillis contracted COVID-19 at a White House event even though he was wearing a mask

If this were true the story would be silly. But it was a lie

Tillis was photographed indoors at the event w/o a mask

https://t.co/cuMkbNsO8Z https://t.co/MVAMOvBnzD3. Breitbart uses this lie to falsely suggest that there is a "lack of consensus on the controversial subject" of mask-wearing. This is another dangerous lie. 

But Facebook said the article DID NOT VIOLATE ITS COVID-19 MISINFORMATION POLICY.

Some policy

https://t.co/cuMkbNsO8Z5. In July, Breitbart published a Facebook video claiming hydroxychlorquine was a "cure" for COVID. Facebook staff asked Zuckerberg how Breitbart could still be part of Facebook News. Zuckerberg said a publisher is removed if it gets 2 strikes in 90 days

https://t.co/cuMkbNsO8ZHydroxychloroquine for thee, but not for me https://t.co/dYQyJXQPhAFacebook gives Breitbart a pass for COVID misinformation by @JuddLegum https://t.co/vqbPvjju3M1. For MONTHS Trump relentlessly promoted hydroxycloroquine as an effective treatment for COVID

He said the opposition was political.

He posted a video touting it as a "cure"

He had the federal government purchase millions of doses

Then he got COVID..

https://t.co/XStSm5PNFJ3. The VA continued to give veterans hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID even after a study of veterans found veterans who received the drug were more likely to die

More than 3500 veterans died under the VA's care

https://t.co/XStSm5PNFJWhen 2020 Chemistry Laureates Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna investigated the immune system of a Streptococcus bacterium they discovered a molecular tool that can be used to make precise incisions in genetic material: CRISPR/Cas9.

CNBC reported that it would be in place for the duration of the pandemic

This month, BofA ended the payments

https://t.co/OU6aojjOYR@BankofAmerica 2. @BankofAmerica didn't announce that the pandemic pay increase was ending. https://t.co/JhoV1QDaTS obtained an internal memo which announced the change. 

It comes as COVID cases are spiking around the country

https://t.co/OU6aojjOYR4. Why is @BankofAmerica ending the pay increase now? The bank did not respond to a request for comment.

This is straight out of the corporate PR playbook. Get free press on the announcement. Go underground when you roll it back as the pandemic spikes

https://t.co/OU6aojjOYR@jilevin "On the first day of the moratorium, @Facebook approved numerous Trump ads that appeared to violate its pre-election policies. At the same time, @Facebook rejected scores of ads, many from groups aligned with Democrats," Zuckerberg is a danger to America. https://t.co/tlhRZQt2Er1. @Amazon donated $41,533.71 to the nation's leading source of vaccine misinformation, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), according to documents obtained exclusively by Popular Information

Thanks @gorskon for heads up https://t.co/WYcIEQoK5n2. Sen. Loeffler has never been elected to any office and won just 26% of the vote  Tuesday in a crowded field 

After attending a private briefing on COVID on Jan 24, she invested up to 250K in Citrix, a company that makes work-from-home software

https://t.co/EJOgoHHUg05. The other GOP incumbent, Sen Perdue is also a multi-millionaire who, as the pandemic took hold in the US, sold 165K in stock in Ceasar's Entertainment and purchased up to 185K in DuPont, which manufactures PPE

https://t.co/EJOgoHHUg02. After election day, the Trump campaign has sent more than 150 emails soliciting donations

The appeals come about once every hour

There are tens of millions of people on the list

If even a tiny fraction are donating, that's millions a day

https://t.co/JU88kMP3S7This pandemic is exploding. Meanwhile, Trump's top covid "advisor" is a radiologist who claims masks don't work &amp; has come out on Fox News encouraging large gatherings for Thanksgiving.
This piece is truly stunning: 
Dr. Death by @JuddLegum https://t.co/KBQmxt1nKaThis account was removed 5 hours after I contacted Facebook today about some of Larry Cook's posts on his Stop Mandatory Vaccination page. 

Details on how it went down, and why Facebook says it took action, in tomorrow's newsletter. 

https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo https://t.co/beMRMWJMd4There is no vaccine for misinformation by @JuddLegum https://t.co/t8x72M9tg41. The good news is there appears to be at least two highly effective vaccines

The bad news is that they only work if you taken them and 40%+ of Americans say they won't

Vaccine misinfo continues to reach substantial audiences on Facebook and YouTube

https://t.co/gQUnhOmiRc2. Facebook does not ban vaccine misinformation. It says it will reduce its distribution. 

Yesterday, Popular Information sent Facebook three examples of vaccine misinformation that attracted significant audiences on Facebook

https://t.co/gQUnhOmiRcThere is no vaccine for misinformation by @JuddLegum https://t.co/yv4z6q7btb"[Amazon] could have quadrupled the hazard pay it gave frontline workers and still earned more profit than the previous year,” according to the Brookings report.

The greed epidemic by @JuddLegum https://t.co/HqBLCfBxS51. There has been a massive failure in CORPORATE leadership during the pandemic

Major retailers are seeing record profits this year

But frontline workers who are putting their lives on the line to generate those profits are getting very little in return

https://t.co/q9pLAHYBgP6. @Amazon stock price is up 65%, adding $73 billion to CEO Jeff Bezos' personal wealth. 

At least 19,816 frontline Amazon employees tested positive for COVID since March. 

https://t.co/q9pLAHYBgP1. There is a massive spike in coronavirus cases across the country and NO MAJOR RETAILER has reinstated hazard pay. 

This spring there was less hazard but more pay 

https://t.co/q9pLAHYBgP3. In April, when more details of his pandemic-related stock trades became public, a Perdue spokesperson told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Perdue "is not involved in day-to-day decisions."

That was a lie. 

https://t.co/i5gEhyjuL41. Loeffler's campaign has devolved into a series of attacks on Warnock's theology

She distorts snippets of Warnock's sermons to depict him as "dangerous" &amp; "radical"

But last January Loeffler shared the pulpit w/Warnock &amp; praised the work of his church

https://t.co/LCjNVL1jNU1. It's December in the middle of a deadly pandemic which has brought significant chunks of the economy to a halt and we are still allowing people to be evicted. 

This decision is killing people. 

https://t.co/cQMxHgCsLu4. Mitch McConnell is proposing a COVID relief bill that allows business executives to fully deduct the cost of expensive lunches but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for renters. It's ghoulish. 

https://t.co/cQMxHgCsLu1. @Walmart has a massive ad on the Washington Post website today, thanking its employees for working during a deadly pandemic.

Not mentioned: The company has provided ZERO hazard pay since August. 

https://t.co/q9pLAHYBgP https://t.co/z2oVRC3RjT@Walmart 2. Walmart's hazard pay over the entire course of the pandemic has amounted to an additional 63 cents per hour. 

Meanwhile, its net income has so far risen 45% this year to a record $15.6B

The stock is up 41%, adding more than $45B to the Walton fortune

https://t.co/q9pLAHYBgP1. These companies all donated thousands to Perdue or Loeffler since Election Day:

@Microsoft

@GoldmanSachs 

@BankofAmerica

@Ford

@GM 

They also are publicly calling on the new Congress to act on climate

If Perdue or Loeffler win, that won't happen

https://t.co/BvU3XuqVHr1. In March and April, when the stock market was tanking, Republicans supported large COVID relief legislation 

Since then, things have gotten much worse for PEOPLE, but the MARKET has recovered and the GOP has blocked further relief 

https://t.co/RiEBb1UQwC https://t.co/WSrhyNxsch2. McConnell is interested in a new COVID relief package which could be because he suddenly cares about the economic condition of working people OR it could be that Perdue and Loeffler are both running on additional COVID relief and he needs one to win

https://t.co/RiEBb1UQwC1. Due to a legal quirk, the Perdue and Loeffler campaigns don't reveal their recent donors until 12/24. 

BUT individual corporate PACs were required to file on 12/3

I reviewed hundreds of filings to uncover Perdue and Loeffler's recent corporate donors

https://t.co/b86m39x6BaHypocritical corporations are funding the inside-trader Georgia Senators who are blocking pandemic aid and undermining democratic norms.

These corporations are funding the GOP candidates in Georgia's Senate run-off elections by @JuddLegum https://t.co/i9Rvj5aOJe1. Today, doses of a highly-effective vaccine are rolling out across the country.

At the same time, COVID vaccine misinfo is spreading across Facebook and Instagram

Facebook pledged to remove COVID vaccine misinfo on Dec 3, but it's not happening 

https://t.co/C2atVpaPk4Despite new policy, vaccine misinformation is spreading on Facebook and Instagram by @JuddLegum https://t.co/ijNvD9B53wGaming vaccine priority by @JuddLegum https://t.co/iP3lCnu5bJ2. In Phase 1B, the vaccine will be made available for "essential" workers. 

Some categories aren't controversial. Teachers, firefighters, grocery workers.

But the finance industry is lobbying to get deemed "essential" 

In some states they've succeeded

https://t.co/C1w70u8jED5. Antibody treatments are in extremely limited supply -- and seem to work pretty well. Trump and all his friends were able to secure access. 

https://t.co/C1w70u8jED1. A bill that would make it more difficult for companies to import products made with slave labor in the Xinjiang region of China passed the House by a vote of 406-3.

Now it looks likely to die in the Senate.

Why?

Successful corporate lobbying.

https://t.co/EqqZabwHfr3. Buttar also falsely claims that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug touted by Trump, has a 99% success rate against COVID-19 

Some of his videos have been viewed 500K+ times on Facebook 

None of his recent posts have been fact-checked or removed

https://t.co/sZWHqgndrD1. Facebook talks a lot about all the steps its taking to limit misinformation about COVID-19

Is it working?

Not really

Dangerous conspiracy theories  about COVID-19 continue to run rampant on the platform

https://t.co/sZWHqgndrDKroger enjoyed lots of good press for giving "hero bonus" pay increases to grocery store workers. But even though the pandemic is far from over — and even though Kroger's business is booming — that additional hourly pay is ending next week.
https://t.co/gHyuIhlXjjThis moments kind of drift by but it's important for everyone in America to understand what's happening right now.

At @slpng_giants, we’re emailing directly to ask why they can’t afford $2/hr for their workers.

https://t.co/gIYpOA1vws1. @kroger CEO Rodney McMullen is paid $12 million per year

Sales at his stores are booming

Multiple Kroger workers have died of COVID-19

But, as the pandemic rages, McMullen plans to rescind its $2/hour "hero bonus" for hourly employees in six days

https://t.co/ICHm10HySa1. Tens of thousands of nursing home residents are dying of COVID-19

In response, the nursing home industry has launched a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign to acquire legal immunity against residents

https://t.co/zzUbizrcspOn Friday, Pence went to Iowa and met w/RON CAMERON of MOUNTAIRE FARMS

Trump is providing Cameron legal immunity so he can keep processing chicken even though his plants are a source of major COVID-19 outbreaks

https://t.co/Bs5nioxzEcNEW: Kroger says "three employees have tested positive for the new coronavirus at its St. Bernard store" in Cincinnati, Ohio

The company plans to cut worker salaries by $2/hour on Sunday by rolling back the "hero bonus"

https://t.co/Qq7QEyxgRG https://t.co/2b8E1N11AI5. Second, Facebook has made a policy decision that conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 are not dangerous enough to warrant removal 

Facebook has made this explicit

https://t.co/sZWHqgndrD5. Trump's campaign is touting junk data about hydroxychloroquine from a fringe group that suggested HIV doesn't cause AIDS and Obama hypnotized Jews https://t.co/bimVmRVIA41. Facebook has said UNEQUIVOCALLY that posts claiming masks will make you sick "could lead to imminent harm" &amp; will be removed

On Monday, I reported Facebook wasn't enforcing the policy &amp; Facebook responded by removing many of the examples I highlighted

https://t.co/2mNOvFqYPc2. Posts claiming masks will make you sick continue to proliferate on Facebook. 

For example, this post by the "Conservative Republicans of Texas" which claims masks "create serious health risks for the wearer" 

https://t.co/2mNOvFqYPc https://t.co/JJdvvxntqY4. As COVID-19 began spreading in January, Bright pushed officials to secure more N95 masks. He was then excluded from meetings for causing a "shit storm." 

The gov't didn't order masks for 2 more months. As a result, doctors and nurses weren't protected

https://t.co/mZ9GlyXOeU6. Despite this and earlier studies showing the drug was ineffective and dangerous, the VA continues to give hydroxychloroquine to veterans 

https://t.co/bshZRy5V6fThe VA reported 51 more deaths from COVID-19 today.

How many of those veterans were treated with hydroxychloroquine, a dangerous drug that has not proven to be effective in treating COVID-19?

https://t.co/bshZRy5V6fThe VA reported 51 more veterans have died of COVID-19

The VA has continued to use hydroxychloroquine to treat veterans despite a study showing it was ineffective and linked to higher death rates

https://t.co/bshZRy5V6f1. The whistleblower report filed by Dr. Rick Bright is an explosive expose of dysfunction and corruption at an HHS agency tasked with "coordinating production, acquisition, and delivery of medical countermeasures during a pandemic response" 

https://t.co/mZ9GlyXOeU3. Keep in mind, all of this is happening BEFORE SCHOOLS are open. 

Ohio and Kansas and other states do not provide exemptions for parents who don't have childcare options. 

They are taking away state and federal unemployment benefits from families

https://t.co/AAWT94apD55. During the pandemic, there has been a lot of talk about personal responsibility

The GOP is devoting millions to this effort

https://t.co/4EPkMvRa5u https://t.co/yDK4SLLtZlUPDATE: As @Kroger plans to roll back it's $2/hour "hero bonus" for frontline employees, another Kroger worker -- 60-year-old James Andres -- died in Michigan yesterday.

He is at least the 5th Kroger employee to die in Michigan after contracting COVID-19

https://t.co/ICHm10HySa https://t.co/s3F1RJWpib2. COVID-19 did not create the problems at nursing homes. It exposed them. 

The GAO found that between 2013 and 2017, 82% of the nation's 15,000 nursing homes had "an infection prevention and control deficiency cited in one or more years."

https://t.co/zzUbizrcsp https://t.co/8khUUQQAFXStudies have found that Hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. 

It's killing veterans.

(Trump also, AFIK, does not have COVID-19.)

https://t.co/bshZRy5V6fAnother 52 Veterans have died under the care of the VA.

Is the VA still administering hydroxychloroquine, despite growing evidence that it makes things worse?

A @Kroger manager in Tennessee died yesterday

A cashier in Michigan died on Sunday

That hasn't altered Kroger's plans

https://t.co/h5hqhifWtxIn the middle of a pandemic, Trump's campaign manager is touting the research of a fringe medical group that has suggested HIV does not cause AIDS, nicotine isn't addictive, and Obama won the presidency by hypnotizing Jews 

https://t.co/bimVmRVIA4UPDATE: @Kroger just disclosed CEO Rodney McMullen received $21 MILLION in compensation in 2019

The details of his compensation package may explain why McMullen is so eager to end the "hero bonus," cutting wages by $2/hour in the middle of a pandemic

https://t.co/h5hqhifWtx.@kroger's executives are making a bet

The bet is that most people won't notice or care that they are cutting pay for hourly workers by $2 during a pandemic

Why are they risking it?

Reducing labor costs could earn the execs millions in bonuses
