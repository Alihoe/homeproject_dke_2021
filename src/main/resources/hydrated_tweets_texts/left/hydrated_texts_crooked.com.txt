1. Recognizing they have all the leverage.

2. Using it to write a stimulus that matches the crisis, spans administrations, protects the election.

3. Ramping up oversight to expose Trump's deadly failure.

https://t.co/hNS5mzr1nYThe latest @DataProgress polling in @crookedmedia shows how the party focusing on the Court instead of coronavirus relief is hurting them in seats they should be winning. (Also Cunningham is fine). https://t.co/ZQMjipVrKnThis was from June. It’s happening almost exactly as written here, and the window to change the trajectory is closing. 
https://t.co/wWaNCwsGXv https://t.co/4wKzuxVeKcGreat point from @brianbeutler: Why have Democrats mostly ignored the fact that Amy Coney Barrett exhibited extreme reckless behavior—no masks, no social distancing, schmoozing indoors—at her own confirmation ceremony? Doesn’t that reflect on her judgment? https://t.co/VGQJVHtdelIt was a privilege to interview a personal hero of mine on #AmericaDissected—and just about the only person in the administration who is showing any leadership on #COVID19 right now: #DrFauci. 

Take a listen: https://t.co/CKLiUG5WUVIt’s #hysteria’s 100th episode!!!  Ft @AlyssaMastro44 @RepKarenBass @alexismcgill @megangailey and @rheeqsquared: police reform! A Supreme Court win for women! Men who won’t wear masks! Himbos! Babysitter’s Club! Thieving neighbors! 
https://t.co/cwz4PtpyA3 https://t.co/qGKr3bkEeFI doubt they can cope with this fact.

"The Trump re-election campaign confronts journalists with the question of how to cover a candidate whose entire appeal to voters is fiction—words and actions meant to deceive people about the state of the country..." https://t.co/zV2aYQFWLMBiden's presidency and the future of liberalism alike will be best served if he "portrays his efforts to recover from coronavirus as a catastrophe thrust upon him by decades of conservative attacks on American government." 

Via @brianbeutler:
https://t.co/A6GhntaBnw"What's the moral math of proceeding with plans that might seed multiple new outbreaks (but might not) and lead to numerous deaths (or maybe none), knowing that if I didn’t, one person would certainly die?" This is an extraordinary story by @sarahclazarus:
https://t.co/wkij2Y9drD@brianbeutler Since the right is again whipping up hysteria about "unmasking," here's @TVietor08 &amp; @benrhodes pointing out NSA under Trump "unmasked" identities 9200x in 2016; 9500x in 2017; 17000x in 2018; 10000 in 2019. https://t.co/zuKOdCbPog
