Trump Jr. Now Tied To Banker Behind Russian Money Laundering Scheme by @grantstern https://t.co/0IsQEBXBHN@thomaskaine5 Look, they've been aligning themselves with Russia since the late 1970's. They're so corrupt and disingenuous that they betrayed America while they feigned patriotism. 
https://t.co/p5tXmqEjkCHow were El Chapo's money laundering networks exposed? I don't know, but it happened after @DonaldJTrumpJr met with El Chapo's money launderers in Eastern Europe!

Was that another Trump/FBI sting operation? https://t.co/LiPdrN82UZ https://t.co/Pg6TUI7yaA
