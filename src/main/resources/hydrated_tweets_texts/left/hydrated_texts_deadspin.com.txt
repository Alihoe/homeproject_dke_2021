@Joeynach @JessMcCann34 @whitesox Why not all of them? This reminded me of the best baseball piece written in recent memory (https://t.co/bk0S0JXRe3) As far as #whitesox2020 goes, it could happen if Jerry is still in charge of the $ and realizes he can't take it to his graveA digital journalism dystopia come to life, Sports Illustrated will soon be turned into a content mill, an SEO play, a lawsuit waiting to happen, and a near certainty for unionization. https://t.co/SQyVNhMo9SThe incomparable @RattoIndy on what happened at Sports Illustrated yesterday:
https://t.co/Hs9c8aBMKvChina seems like its run by such nice fair and honest people. Why wouldn't we want to be involved with them https://t.co/30i2MoF2f7China turning on the Houston Rockets should be a chilling, cautionary moment for any sports organization which is heavily relying on China in its business model (cough WTA cough). https://t.co/0VjecjQqJkAn ESPN exec sent a memo to staffers mandating that coverage of the Morey/China story focus on basketball and avoid political discussions about China and Hong Kong https://t.co/kuXIiQwznhTalking about Morey's tweet and China and the NBA is legitimately difficult. Ignoring what prompted Morey's tweet in the first place doesn't make it any easier and it serves no one (except maybe ESPN's business interests). https://t.co/6fOKob3AfrWow... this is getting ugly. Can’t let China win this propaganda war. “Internal Memo: ESPN Forbids Discussion Of Chinese Politics When Discussing Daryl Morey's Tweet About Chinese Politics” https://t.co/l0W65SVg5L"The memo, obtained by Deadspin, explicitly discouraged any political discussion about China and Hong Kong. Multiple ESPN sources confirmed to Deadspin that network higher-ups were keeping a close eye on how the topic was discussed on ESPN’s airwaves." https://t.co/Z61iCKBpP9Wow. ESPN, owned by Disney, banned its on-air reporters from talking about the fight for democracy in Hong Kong in its coverage of China's efforts to coerce the NBA to shut down support for the fight for democracy in Hong Kong. https://t.co/4gpV3JGIvFESPN has really great reporting (even for a non-sports fan like me) whether it's Tiger Woods, the concussion scandal in the NFL, or their multi-part takedown of Bikram Yoga - but they are omitting a lot of Hong Kong context due to ties with China's Tencent https://t.co/WTkujlY767ESPN, which has long lectured American patriots, has sided with communist China. https://t.co/xD2xIWZe2sThis is next level: A “news director” at ESPN forbids staffers there to discuss any politics related to the NBA / China / Hong Kong controversy — which is about China trying to force NBA executives to self-censor to keep access to China market.  https://t.co/j8Kbexgmo5Members Of Congress Ask Adam Silver To Suspend NBA Activities In China https://t.co/uJ7GyvT8Ed via @deadspinWarren's plan, built on a love of markets, falls short.

Bears will take on a rejuvenated Eagles team after beating down the Bills. 

https://t.co/g5ZkcR9p2AIf you're wondering what's happening at deadspin, this is a good article to read about that, and the general state of digital media today https://t.co/IropVcJY3m"And this was mostly what happened with the extremely obvious and easily predicted story of an unpopular president being booed lustily, in a city where he won six percent of the vote in the previous election." https://t.co/TgthVDmE8g via @deadspinRIP to the Deadspin comments section, which on this post had hosted the funniest insults to my physical appearance I'd ever read. Love and solidarity to those brave writers and I wish you the best.  https://t.co/ZRItIuesfHkinda both can and can't believe what's happened to Deadspin. Incredible respect and admiration for the writers quitting in protest. 

Remember when a "sports website" saw Gamergate for what it was and basically laid out what our future would end up being? https://t.co/9O7yecCEC8Amazingness at @Deadspin right now. The writers and editors quit when idiot bosses stopped them from creating the stories readers liked. But they still have the passwords! So they're still posting stuff like this on the company Twitter account:
https://t.co/eBNf2Vr8LPThe Melbourne Stars won by 44 runs, and I *think* I understand most of how it happened, thanks to Wikipedia and this Deadspin article from 2016 https://t.co/wojNluLmpqThe publication of this, in particular, was a Holy Shit moment. The whole point was to name and shame journos/pundits who acted *correctly* after the long video dropped. (And yes I miss Deadspin dearly and read it daily and want it back -- but still!)

https://t.co/6JeTNVKqQfBaylor commissioned an investigation by outside counsel. But the final report from them left everyone anonymous. All it says is bad things happened. But by who? And who knew? Who did nothing? It never says. I wrote about that issue here: https://t.co/x8xtFcAoIt@PhilippeAuclair Good snapshot of the discourse in US, that. He was never the most beloved--hollow branding, selfish style, Lakers--yet after 20 yrs the hagiography had begun even before he retired. Even so, not everyone forgot about the "complicated" part, either. E.g.:

https://t.co/1YWmyao5ie@Ben13Porter I absolutely hope the first pitch on opening day goes right in the leadoff man’s earhole. 

Should be like the time Dock Ellis popped the first three Cincinnati Reds he faced.

https://t.co/081hc3UcpQ“The fact that the NFLPA Executive Committee voted against the proposal, 7-4, but it was still rushed for a full vote during a pandemic without providing players full and accurate information, and instead giving NFL talking points wreaks of bad faith.”

My latest at @Deadspin... https://t.co/nXmmXuQh0R@DccaDance @B_oySix @AngelaCPMills Tony really didn't draw a lot of walks because he could hit anything thrown at him - so much so Bochy used to let him put on his own hit-and-runs.
