The Trump Admin has asked Ukraine &amp; China to investigate Biden and asked Ukraine, Italy, the UK, &amp; Australia (that we know of) for help discrediting the Mueller probe.

Meanwhile, the FEC is shut down due to a Senate-stalled nomination.

Why @senatemajldr? https://t.co/95QsgUa4SdTrump on the South Lawn: "I have a lot of options on China, *but if they don't do what we want*, we have tremendous power."

Trump seconds later: "China should start an investigation into the Bidens."

While Democrats presented a credible case for impeachment, Republicans presented misleading arguments and false narratives.
https://t.co/YHHkDjDsNo@realDonaldTrump Trump: “I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre-Existing Conditions.”

Also Trump: Pushed to repeal Obamacare and then his DOJ supports a lawsuit that seeks to invalidate the entire ACA, which protects pre-existing conditions.
https://t.co/b4BVaJQQjISusan Collins said Trump learned his lesson after being impeached.

It appears the only lesson he's learned is that when you're a Republican, your party will let you do anything no matter how corrupt.

And more than that, they'll help you do it. https://t.co/QzPsc7k41VOver 3,000 deaths from the coronavirus worldwide.

Over 89,000 cases worldwide.

At least 88 cases, and 2 deaths, within the US.

1 self-centered, incompetent President in over his head.

#CoronaOutbreak https://t.co/H9rocbaGSRThis might get lost in the noise of the primary but let's be clear:

Dems strive to expand healthcare access.

GOP strives to take it away.

Trump's DOJ is trying to invalidate the ACA entirely.

Bottom line: there is no equivalence between the parties.
https://t.co/6T6lezyzkVPresident Trump's obsession with minimizing the threat of coronavirus is actually maximizing it as he dangerously undermines his own administration's efforts to combat it. https://t.co/hiVhJYg9pMHis tweets aren't helping.

His cries of "Dem HOAX" aren't helping.

His lies to minimize the threat are putting people in danger.

Trump's compulsion to make crises significantly worse continues as his #COVID2019 response becomes an unmitigated disaster. https://t.co/Bnrfq0pttYIf you need a primer on coronavirus, I made you one.

Right down to the handy symptoms chart.

https://t.co/sGjB3dpq8oIt's not just like the flu

#COVID19 fears are not a hoax

Because of Trump's botched response and limited testing, we have to be extra careful

Whether you're asymptomatic or not, you must do your part

We can limit the spread if we ALL take precautions
https://t.co/yKNJ3fepcGEveryone who isn’t taking this seriously is doing the opposite of flattening the curve and extending the life of this crisis.

You have no idea if you have COVID-19 or not until you’ve been tested. Asymptomatic people have been tested positive.

Makes you look like the inept "leader" you are. https://t.co/NP04flShAp@realDonaldTrump Trump deleted his other tweet on this so I'm plugging this again.

Trump is attacking Cuomo because his ego can't handle the fact Cuomo is leading one of the best responses to coronavirus in the country while Trump's incompetence is exposed. https://t.co/NP04flShAp@realDonaldTrump Trump really just called it the Chinese virus... https://t.co/NP04flShAp@charliekirk11 Because you conveniently omitted the fact Trump disbanded the NSC global pandemics team in 2018, limited testing after rejecting WHO tests, called coronavirus fears a hoax, and spread disinformation that undercut his administration’s health professionals. https://t.co/NP04flShApTimes are tough.

https://t.co/NP04flShApPresident Trump’s character flaws are being highlighted in his press briefings.

These same flaws are what caused his early coronavirus response to fail.

The US could’ve been months ahead of this. But Donald ignored reality. https://t.co/OTNNk4iogl@realDonaldTrump You can’t say this out of one side of your mouth and then say “Chinese virus” out the other.

It’s a typical Trumpian ploy to fit this pandemic into his nationalist agenda.

This is having discriminatory effects for Asians throughout the country.
https://t.co/iKBTD3Kh5JThe fears were clearly not a Dem "hoax."

This was not an effort to "take President Trump down."

From Trump himself to conservative propagandists on Fox News, conspiracy theories about COVID-19 have put American lives at risk.

The damage is already done. https://t.co/lhwA4h3MPA@realDonaldTrump Here Trump goes with more conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being used to take him down.

The media is not trying to keep the country closed.

Public health experts, including those in Trump’s Admin, are to make sure millions of Americans don’t die.
https://t.co/ROgzeT0CEtThey said COVID-19 fears were a Dem “hoax.”

Then, Trump was a wartime POTUS fighting an “invisible enemy.”

Now, they're downplaying it again.

Watching Fox “News” is like riding a whiplash-inducing roller coaster built on a foundation of gaslighting lies.https://t.co/lhwA4h3MPATrump called coronavirus fears a hoax until it was too late to prevent its spread.

Trump called climate change a hoax but it’s not too late to prevent its catastrophic effects.

Dems aim to combat climate change. GOP exacerbates it.

The choice is clear. https://t.co/Kh3rjvKV6ZDr. Fauci has garnered trust from Americans by delivering the blunt truth about COVID-19 based on science and his expert analysis built on decades of experience advising every president since Reagan.

@realDonaldTrump should step back and let Fauci lead. https://t.co/7g8V250NwQThe coronavirus briefings are supposed to give crucial details about COVID-19 to Americans.

Instead, they're being exploited as campaign events.

https://t.co/ZHBZs1WCNYOn January 20, the US and South Korea both confirmed their first case of COVID-19.

South Korea now has just over 10,000 cases and over 180 deaths.

The US has over 300,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths

This was not inevitable. The Trump Admin failed. https://t.co/kpR2sWioHVRight-wing media, the Trump campaign, and Trump have shared stories stating hydroxychloroquine was rated “most effective” against COVID-19 by 37% of 6,227 doctors in a new poll.

But if you look at the data, only 2,171 doctors responded to that question... https://t.co/f6JOalMBZZTo further clarify:

When you look at the data, only 2,171 of the 6,227 doctors actually treated COVID-19 patients.

So the 37% was actually out of 2,171 doctors surveyed, not the full 6,227.

Rantt contributor @nancylevine spotted the misrepresentation.
https://t.co/f6JOalMBZZRight-Wing Media Misrepresents Hydroxychloroquine Poll | Rantt Media https://t.co/wkJtBUSbh1@realDonaldTrump This is pure gaslighting.

Trump is literally telling us to forget this happened because he absolutely failed at his most important job: protecting the American people.
https://t.co/ozDbrqly1gFor anyone who needs to hear this:

There is absolutely no equivalence between Biden and Trump's approaches to healthcare.

Last time we checked, proposing a public option is not equal to suing to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act.
https://t.co/CSQzgCSGOR695 of the doctors surveyed said 'Nothing' was most effective treatment against coronavirus. 'Nothing' was tied with Azithromycin or other antibiotics (32% of 2171 doctors).

Survey of doctors is anecdotal -- not scientific clinical evidence.

https://t.co/To8cNAiC6a@realDonaldTrump @nytimes They don’t mention it because it doesn’t matter.

These briefings are nothing but a dishonest attempt to rewrite history about Trump’s stunning failures to contain COVID-19.  https://t.co/ozDbrqD9pQ@realDonaldTrump The deaths that have happened already were not inevitable. 

Don’t try and spin this as a win. https://t.co/ozDbrqD9pQRight-wing circles are calling for the economy to reopen too soon.

Not only would it make COVID-19 more deadly, it would cause further economic damage. https://t.co/nbQZCqSvMYTrump just officially announced that he has put WHO funding on hold and accused them of mismanaging and covering up the spread of COVID-19 - exactly what he himself is guilty of.

As I wrote yesterday: https://t.co/1i2UXpsyBMAmid COVID-19, Trump Attempts To Rewrite History https://t.co/EiLvvNqgBNMy latest for Rantt Media. In any time, this position is enormously powerful. In the time of COVID-19, it can (and does) mean life or death for ordinary Americans.

https://t.co/0Au9KXkcQU@realDonaldTrump No deflections will make Americans forget Trump’s failed COVID-19 response. https://t.co/1i2UXpsyBMTrump is addicted to self-sabotage.
