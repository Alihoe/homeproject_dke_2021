“US Billionaire Wealth Surges to $584 Billion, or 20 Percent, Since the Beginning of the Pandemic - Institute for Policy Studies” https://t.co/mXj08lK72X@ConstitutionMod @erlohman @dennisdiclaudio @DemSocialists @JoeBiden You're deflecting. We need vote by mail NOW. This is a pandemic.

USPS already charges Amazon. The problem is the GOP-led pension obligations. The USPS would be profitable without them.

https://t.co/O1DnWFEjgUThe only reason @USPS isn’t profitable is because the GOP-led 109th Congress required that it fund post-retirement healthcare 75 YEARS into the future, a “burden applies to no other federal agency or private corporation.” https://t.co/hmB5jVzKPS@MattEganCNN's piece cites this report from the @IPS_DC titled "Billionaire Bonanza 2020: Wealth Windfalls, Tumbling Taxes, and Pandemic Profiteers": https://t.co/qSdlqXHCgY400 richest in US own same wealth as bottom 64%. As 30 million jobs are lost, many of the richest got richer. 

Even in a pandemic, capitalism redistributes wealth to richest.
#HowCapitalismWorks

https://t.co/T9wUfiAVm110yrs ago, several dozen U.S. #billionaires pledged to give away half their wealth.

During the worst months of the #pandemic so far—when we needed aid—instead of decreasing from donations, those billionaires' collective wealth increased by $213B.

Report:
https://t.co/hQa4hp97p8 https://t.co/l0By5vxGppBezos could have paid each of Amazon’s 876,000 workers a $105,000 bonus and would still be as wealthy as he was when the pandemic began.

Instead, their $2/hr hazard pay was revoked while 20,000 got #COVID.

Our newest report w/ @forrespect &amp; @bcgproject:

https://t.co/yQBPeuNcXIArsenal say they plan to shed 55 jobs because of the pandemic. 

(Owner Stan Kroenke’s wealth estimated at $8.3 billion according to Forbes, up by $400m from Jan to Apr according to the “Billionaire Bonanza 2020” report by Institute for Policy Studies) 
https://t.co/BfGeXwRiyI https://t.co/pml8j5L0nz@nick_kapur Our latest report shows that, from 1980-2018, U.S. billionaires reduced their tax obligations by nearly 80%.

Outrageous.

This might explain why they're profiting wildly during the pandemic:
https://t.co/PBa2Ya4PymEquality doesn't just magically happen with time - in fact, with inaction, it can get worse.

In the 1980s the median white family had 14x the wealth of the median black family.

Now? It's 41x.

In that time, black wealth dropped nearly in half
https://t.co/o4qr1BWVxk https://t.co/T0B6uYD0dkHow badly must Elon Musk be hurting if he's forcing thousands of his workers to put their lives on the line?

Actually, after Jeff Bezos, no one in the U.S. has profited more during the pandemic.
https://t.co/PBa2Y9Ne9M https://t.co/dkxRpqjvyITop 5 US billionaires—Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Buffett &amp; Ellison—have seen their wealth grow by $101.7 billion, 26%, since pandemic shutdown. They've captured 17.4% of the total wealth growth of all 600-plus US billionaires. @inequalityorg @ips_dc https://t.co/sGwZEp7fJD https://t.co/FczjGe4wHp“Billionaire Bonanza 2020: Wealth Windfalls, Tumbling Taxes, and Pandemic Profiteers” / Report: Billionaire Bonanza 2020 - Institute for Policy Studies https://t.co/1CVpW4TCBKAs Brother Jonathan @WilsonHartgrove said so well, “‘Pandemic profiteers’ this report from @IPS_DC calls them. The biblical word for this is ‘evil.’”

https://t.co/mx4PlgIQ5f@PattyMurray @USPS Seems the House is responsible for the current “poor policy” which manifests USPS to hemeorage $$. Rescind the “unheard” of USPS prepaying healthcare and retiement. If not kiss the USPS good bye. https://t.co/CcfZhveDNfCan't wait to hear whether Hunter Biden brushes his teeth twice a day during the #PresidentialDebate2020. 

Looking for more substance on critical issues impacting Americans?@IPS_DC documented how #COVID19 has exacerbated class, race &amp; gender divides. https://t.co/R6P7AnZovRCheck out this report by our comrades Luis Solano, Ellen Moore (@Earthworks, former NISGUA staff) &amp; Jen Moore (@IPS_DC)  “Mining Injustice through International Arbitration,” a documentation of human rights violations by Kappes, Cassidy, &amp; Associates. https://t.co/mN372oqh18For those going around taking pictures of property damage, I invite you to remember this side of the story, too:

Billionaire Bonanza 2020: Wealth Windfalls, Tumbling Taxes, And Pandemic Profiteers

https://t.co/em7yfamgPoThe pandemic has killed thousands, but the wealth of Amazon's Jeff Bezos has increased by $25 billion this year -- more than the entire GDP of 80 countries. Many Amazon workers earn so little they rely on food subsidies. Obscene.
https://t.co/JtjXoNdRlx https://t.co/eZjd2QWw6U@mikecgrimes @TrumpetCrusher @RossGinsberg @kylegriffin1 This is not true. Where r u getting your news from? Trump has even put his own crony in charge of the Post Office. At best your views are ill informed....At worst disingenuous. This is what happened:
https://t.co/8mfDNPpuZjOn #Juneteenth, as we look back on the history of Black freedom, we must also look to the future.

The inequality of the pandemic is unjustly hurting Black people.

Our newest report gives 8 solutions to ensure #Recovery reduces our #RacialWealthDivide:

https://t.co/o3fd7e8vy5According to the @IPS_DC report, no one has benefited as much as #JeffBezos, whose wealth surge is unprecedented: Bezos’ wealth has increased over $25 billion since Jan 1, 2020 and $12 billion since Feb 21st, 2020, the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/QuJUPxsS4LCruel Immigration Policies Make the Pandemic Worse - 
https://t.co/AKBE45CmYAJust read something about Big Philanthropy’s machinations in the WSJ yesterday (1/2) https://t.co/kw6RvGY1ebRelated— the road to zero wealth for black families has been hastened by the Covid-19 crisis. https://t.co/3ibiL8WQI5 https://t.co/wpZPJm1XkMMeanwhile, #COVID19 is exacerbating poverty and inequality.

A new data visualization series by @SarahDAnderson1 and Brian Wakamo @IPS_DC illustrates how COVID and flawed policy responses have widened long-standing economic, racial, and gender divides. https://t.co/R6P7AnZovR https://t.co/8d2zCB990zAmerican billionaires gain $1 Trillion while knowingly risking the lives of their workers during a pandemic - https://t.co/9bKY5ENzrEThe Green New Deal &amp; Beyond author @CoxStan discusses the prospects for a GND, the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, &amp; what it will take to address climate change in a sustainable manner.
