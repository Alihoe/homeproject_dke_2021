This wasn't a black swan event. It was the No 1 security risk facing the UK.

Not terrorism, cyber attacks, flooding or a blackout.

A pandemic.

So why were we so slow to act? 1/…because the UK *never intended to suppress* a future pandemic. 

The govt have known the NHS would be overwhelmed since at least 2009.

The aim has only ever been to "mitigate" impact.

A lockdown was not anticipated. Nor was mass testing or tracing.

https://t.co/f9SfD8dPUqThere is a very real possibility of Britain largely eliminating the fatality risk of the virus by early spring. 

@harrytlambert on how Covid-19 vaccines could rapidly reduce the UK’s death rate: https://t.co/Kw3YUXPi7k https://t.co/rdijESBJD5This article explains why the 4 million doses due to arrive this year could reduce the death rate from COVID by 40% and hospital admissions by 20% (by vaccinating all over 85s). This will reduce pressure on the NHS - a key criteria for moving down tiers.

https://t.co/fY1ZZB0LtvIf it weren't for Covid and Brexit, this would be the biggest story of the year and beyond - the shocking revelations at the Grenfell inquiry.

How can the government pledge to "build back better" when this is the reality of building/refurbing UK housing?

https://t.co/UP0NJp6OrqA thought or two on the vaccine roll out. 
One piece of very good news is that we don’t have to vaccinate that many people before the deaths start coming down. As @harrytlambert suggests, vaccinate 75+s (9% of the population) &amp; fatalities cut by 71%. /1
