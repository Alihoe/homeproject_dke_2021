Note: Reality Winner was the heroine who blew the whistle on Russian hacking in #Election2016From the very beginning, Reality Winner’s rights were violated. She never stood a chance to defend herself. She remains silenced and imprisoned with a record-breaking sentence to this day. She is one of the vulnerable inmates held captive amidst #COVID19 https://t.co/DaoC9iXbNMCOVID-19 didn’t make incarceration deadly. It always was a possible death sentence to be imprisoned. For example, death rates have been rising for much of last decade &amp; most who died in jails &amp; prisons btwn ‘00 and ‘13 spent **7 days or less in custody.** https://t.co/BjL5X75DfHThis has built for months: prison systems are putting people in the torture of solitary confinement as a way to respond to incarcerated people's fears and protests about COVID-19. https://t.co/aFjOwbztPA"'When Assange was willing to speak with investigators about the Russia probe, he [Democrat Adam Schiff] replied, 'Our committee would be willing to interview Julian Assange when he is in US custody, not before.'" - &gt; https://t.co/lpfCTEcMoS

https://t.co/li7V7ejRYHIn the past week, COVID-19 infections have tripled at FMC Carswell, where NSA whistleblower Reality Winner is incarcerated. 

Reality's bunkmate tested positive for COVID-19, and she continues to fight in court for a compassionate release. https://t.co/zOGCzE6L2ONSA whistleblower Reality Winner appealed a court decision against her release. "A favorable decision will pave the way for other prisoners to seek relief in accordance with the clear intent of the First Step Act," her attorneys contend. https://t.co/3lnPNgNIGG@tedcruz

I personally reached out to each of you asking for your help.  This is happening in your state yet none of you have acted to protect #RealityWinner  or anyone else. 
https://t.co/3lrljzFKzB#2: Federal judge Randal Hall denied NSA whistleblower Reality Winner's request for compassionate release from FMC Carswell and disregarded many of the risks COVID-19 poses to prisoners as BOP fails to respond adequately. (This was a follow-up.)

This is all part of effort as independent media organization to do what we can to show solidarity during journalism crisis: https://t.co/qJSH6N9Ozo #Covid_19It is pretty hard to understand how you "Restore Promise" in a prison system where thousands of prisoners don't even get access to sunlight or fresh air in their cells.
