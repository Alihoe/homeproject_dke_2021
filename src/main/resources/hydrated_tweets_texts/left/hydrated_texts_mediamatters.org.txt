Such hypocrisy.
https://t.co/zMzRRjoh2wLast week, Fox &amp; Friends, Tucker Carlson Tonight, and The Ingraham Angle all trumpeted a local Fox affiliate's report that Nashville's mayor had covered up covid data. https://t.co/sH2n25vabz

The story was debunked and the station retracted it. Here's how those shows responded.There have now been 200,000 coronavirus deaths in the US.

Fox News has complained about coronavirus health measures nearly 5 times as often as it reported the national death toll.
 https://t.co/hu3VtafETc https://t.co/hdG5HQxx8uNEW STUDY from @mmfa: 

Since Sept 1, Fox News has mentioned the coronavirus national death toll or daily death rate in 55 segments. 

They undermined mitigation efforts like social distancing and mask wearing in 260 segments. 

An imbalance of 5 to 1 https://t.co/QGbLZrTVRv https://t.co/swengoRpGIFox News hosts have had more impact on the U.S. response to the pandemic than any other source -- and it shows. https://t.co/MBkIsS6qWm https://t.co/Hjieieb4RwFrom September 1 - September 20, all opinion shows like Fox &amp; Friends ran 162 segments with complaints about public health measures. Only 7 of them contained the national death toll, because covid is a bad issue for Trump and Fox News wants to re-elect him https://t.co/rmzrw1ORKS https://t.co/cuCZXUbXWgJust a reminder that Brennan was very much a puppet master in this Russian collusion fairytale.

https://t.co/qKiw6rm6yv https://t.co/jXwrMvSeGAThe president's takeaway from his brush with COVID thus far is that his unwillingness to follow public health recommendations has been vindicated, a bonkers take that is precisely what his media allies have been feeding him. https://t.co/hHg7rdgznLTucker Carlson: Trump leaving Walter Reed proves "coronavirus isn't quite as scary as they're telling you it is" https://t.co/esiIMSUNsePro-Trump media delusionally claim that Donald Trump’s diagnosis of COVID-19 that led to his hospitalization caused by his flouting of public health guidelines is proof that COVID prevention measures are not needed.
