https://t.co/NvbRAXT2HROkay, it's pretty obvious that David Purdue might be using insider trading information he is obtaining from his position in the Senate to personally profit, including his latest buy of Pfizer right before the company announced they had a viable vaccine. 
https://t.co/WDll6c1QrdIn a series of transactions in late February, Senator Perdue invested up to $245,000 in the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. That was just one week before Pfizer announced that it would develop a vaccine, raising questions about what he knew, and when.
https://t.co/nM5rxoU5XoIf Senator Perdue bought Pfizer stock based on inside communications with government officials about vaccine plans, it is truly worse than insider trading.
