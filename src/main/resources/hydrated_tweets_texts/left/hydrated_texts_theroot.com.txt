The racial wealth gap will widen and people will lose their homes unless we pass rental protections for communities of color.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp: I Totally Messed Up Reopening the State, Growing Outbreak Is Stressing Resources https://t.co/sygZBTKRrtNYC Mayor Bill de Blasio says the NYPD will no longer carry out enforcement action for mask-wearing except when there is a "serious danger to the public." It remains to be seen if cops will be able to distinguish between that and “existing while black.” https://t.co/GdklaLmS8X https://t.co/gBWvT5Xu4gMBDTF's snub was insane, but typical. The Grammys were mad that they were gonna HAVE to acknowledge it when it dropped in November 2010, but when Adele "21" went diamond, they felt they were off the hook. I wrote this album 10 years later. Still relevant.
