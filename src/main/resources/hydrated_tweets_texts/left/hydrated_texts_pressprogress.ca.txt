BLOODY IDIOTS! Workers at Cargill’s Alberta Meat Plant Were Offered Special ‘Bonus’ Pay For Perfect Attendance During Pandemic

This would ensure some workers come to work, sick. Everyone should get the same pay and be paid sick leave, so they can stay home when sick.

(https://t.co/qbMMCrPQ6D)Wow. A UCP MLA had actually threatened to evict a tenant in the middle of the pandemic.

The cruelty and disregard for others is unbelievable.

This is why we are calling for stronger renter protections during this crisis.

Manitoba’s covid spread isn’t the worst in Canada because Manitobans are “idiots” – literally hundreds of doctors signed letters criticizing Pallister for mismanaging the pandemic.

Jason Kenney always blames someone ELSE for Alberta's problems.

Healthcare workers are not the problem. Healthcare workers are heroes.
