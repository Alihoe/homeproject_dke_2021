If you're in need of some Sunday late morning listening, @aldatweets and I talked to @_waleedshahid about realignment, Bernie Sanders and campaigning under quarantine and you can listen to it here https://t.co/geSn5D8eZ5The new issue of Dissent is here with a feast of good reading and smart politics: https://t.co/42tyLJCzIp
It also happens to be the last issue I will co-edit for a magazine I love: https://t.co/N8dWV6tDkGOur Spring 2020 issue is out today!

With a special section, Know Your Enemy, edited by @SamAdlerBell @MatthewSitman &amp; @laurenstokes featuring @daniel_dsj2110 @maximillian_alv @onesarahjones @JamesChappel @kirstenweld 

https://t.co/zSm3Bj2hH5 https://t.co/uNaU7QeZajThe COVID crisis has cast into stark relief what has always been true: the wealth and prosperity of the U.S. economy rests on the labor, and the lives, of black and brown people. https://t.co/f5BbriHjxxThanks @aldatweets @KateAronoff @colinreads for a fine conversation on the Hot And Bothered podcast on food, the New Deal and what comes after #COVID19 @DissentMag  https://t.co/Ih1wBAisal https://t.co/nmTtdJhXiU"Vermeule's story shows us just how easily technocracy, by evacuating the moral center of our politics, can tip toward a moralizing authoritarianism that promises to restore one." @JamesChappel in @DissentMag: https://t.co/hI0AsJBD2Y"Why does it have to be that I either care about polar bears or police violence? That’s a false dichotomy.” 

@MaryHeglar is spot on talking about how not to talk about the climate crisis &amp; coronavirus, and so much more, on this week's #HotBotheredClimate https://t.co/jg4J9pOVbl"The ubiquity of funeral rites for liberalism can distract attention from those few who are genuinely committed to its murder." —@JamesChappel

https://t.co/LgO6qtIxQ5It's so easy to neglect Hong Kong these days — the global pandemic has captured so much attention. All the more reason to read @jwassers's piece in @DissentMag (also read his book!): https://t.co/QsQMmgeXq9#Belabored: Belabored Podcast #203: What the Pandemic Taught Us About Basic Income, with Barb Jacobson https://t.co/8pxHFqpSqxCongress has left for vacation until September. In the middle of a pandemic &amp; #BlackLivesMatter social upheaval, they leave with No #RentFreeze, #MortgageMoratorium #UBI #MedicareForAll It is time for #GeneralStrike #RentStrike 

https://t.co/aGrrsdZSqpThe conservative response to COVID-19 has been defined by its heterogeneity: a blur of contradictory recriminations, confirmation biases, and conspiracy peddling.

@SamAdlerBell https://t.co/2jKWVryjsVWe start talking about Richard Epstein's libertarian COVID trutherism — and its roots in Chicago School style economic thinking — at 1:00:50 here: https://t.co/jcTw6Zyt8pRead this account on #COVID19 from incarcerated folks at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility: https://t.co/2ps5tXIGdK

Then call @NYGovCuomo @NYSDOCCS #FreeSurvivors #FreeThemAll #FreeThemAll4PublicHealth.  https://t.co/Y1rEdQQNnX"To respond to the pandemic we need to broaden our political imaginations. Our conception of solidarity must cross the species barrier."
@astradisastra &amp; @sunaura_taylor  https://t.co/Nx7pkMdf9H via @DissentMagI spoke with a CVS pharmacy technician who had COVID-19 about his frustrations with the process, from testing to reporting to work to PPE to the hazard pay he has yet to see. 
https://t.co/aNvkQzCwsdMany workers have been furious about the callous treatment they’ve faced during the pandemic. Many recognize that the best way to win better treatment &amp; the protections they need is thru collective action--and unionization. But many employers have dug in. https://t.co/0LUbB7vSco https://t.co/TNFDV3w3ltEveryone should read @JamesChappel's brilliant and informed take on Adrian Vermeule (with particularly interesting stuff on his intellectual roots and ongoing coauthorships with seemingly [?] very different folks). @casssunstein https://t.co/9SdOq7EG4z“The pandemic has been raging for nearly a year. It is understandable that people in rich nations want to restore some kind of normalcy in their lives. But now is the time to demand...the liberation of the vaccine from big pharma.“
https://t.co/kUVstT8NWOHong Kong's Fragile Autonomy | my latest on developments in HKG during this Year of the Rat (with nods back to earlier Years of the Rat, such as 1984 &amp; 2008, &amp; discussion of the coronavirus and the expulsion of journalists) cc @BeijingPalmer  https://t.co/OATZyM8EvE.@NaomiAKlein on the promise of a #GreenNewDeal: "...A new form of democratic #ecosocialism, with the humility to learn from indigenous teachings...appears to be humanity’s best shot at collective survival." @sunrisemvmt @DissentMag  https://t.co/eyCoIDudm3Kim Phillips-Fein on the travails of a generation: "At its most appealing, Gen X stood for an antagonism toward the political establishment and a deflation of pretension…but it also embodied a mood of resignation" which "it's time finally to put to rest." https://t.co/AQ5y6Oqkq6Soy Sros works at a Cambodian factory that makes luxury goods for Michael Kors, Versace, and Coach. In March, she criticized her employers’ Covid response—then was thrown into prison as the pandemic raged. I interviewed her after her release months later: https://t.co/64rVRcZCtrThe great bursts of progress under Lincoln, FDR, and LBJ, happened not because those they were deeply progressive men, but because people's movements forced those presidents to rise to the moment. 

This is truly a must read from @cwabobmaster.

https://t.co/pk75yrnh9DThis is the best thing I have read so far on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy by @Jayati1609 
https://t.co/EM5j3K7LzfElections in a Pandemic: The Crisis Response Should Be Permanent Policy https://t.co/0JsTrM6SAI via @DissentMagReally enjoyed Nudging Towards Theocracy: Adrian Vermeule’s War on Liberalism
By @JamesChappel in @DissentMag
Might have emphasized more strongly the internal intellectual connection btw Vermeule’s Schmittanism &amp; his turn to Catholicism.
https://t.co/9NM8gjbhCN https://t.co/lw6OHrO8QuExcellent article by Adele Lebano:
All Luck and No Virtue: Sweden’s Coronavirus Response https://t.co/Lh6dtclqTY via @DissentMagSo news: @aldatweets and I are bringing back our dormant podcast, Hot &amp; Bothered, for the pandemic. 

First episode drops tomorrow, with a little preview here https://t.co/4wIZyhjAii Contribute here to help cover production costs &amp; for some fun perks: https://t.co/EGaGnpyQ4cThe new @rortybomb piece on the coronavirus relief bill is  a powerful gut punch.

Discusses policy proposals from @arindube, @gabriel_zucman &amp; Saez, Glenn Hubbard, and others

https://t.co/dRFZQ5AFr2 https://t.co/5X0VMqHmXIhello internet have you seen this interview I did with a GE worker involved in the actions demanding the company make ventilators rather than shutting down facilities? cause it's really good: https://t.co/lM8hrTSkzfIn the face of an aggressive assault by the right, the abortion rights movement should abandon its defensive stance and advocate fully integrating abortion into the country’s healthcare system https://t.co/0VKPlQHbVm @DissentMag"Public health is a social and collective imperative."

Socialized Love in the Face of Pandemic https://t.co/6XZV4zt0qe via @DissentMagThe coronavirus has exposed how little remains of the “one country, two systems” framework. @jwassers https://t.co/CzFwwkH1Dn"L.A. garment workers face a particular disadvantage: they are working in the country with the largest COVID-19 outbreak in the world. And the virus is circulating among workers at an alarming rate, according to the Garment Worker Center."  https://t.co/owqqHEkxQVA personal piece about what just happened over the past two weeks, as I try to process the bill that just passed the Senate.

Serious, even radical, ideas were debated, but they hit the real institutional constraints of a system hostile to real reform.

https://t.co/NSGIdKZkqS @KayhanV @Andreas_Bieler @AdamDavidMorton @gorkemaltinorsThe international left must name what has happened in Bolivia for what it is: a popular mobilization against alleged electoral fraud that was sabotaged by a right-wing, neo-fascist coup. https://t.co/EunSBH2aSc.@meeshellchen and I have been hearing from lots of workers in unsafe conditions during the coronavirus crisis, so we're starting an ongoing series at @DissentMag for them. Here's the first one, from a PA state worker doing means testing https://t.co/zzMkYOxyrz#Belabored live to end 2020: next week, we talk with @rsgexp, @BillFletcherJr and @RebeccaDNELP about how Covid changed work: https://t.co/FxVsMweGr8They explain brilliantly how the housing crisis is a healthcare crisis is a care work crisis is a crisis of criminalization and how all that is because of profits. https://t.co/G0OcOmiKpe"A coalition of unions representing 20,000 workers is organizing to reject the university’s austerity response to the pandemic." Fantastic piece by @sarahljaffe #SolidarityNotAusterity #HigherEdWorksBecauseWeDo https://t.co/zfdD7Qmnbx(this is a very good idea in case my sarcasm didn't carry also here is our latest Belabored about pandemic basic income! https://t.co/CUxS2hvN0F )"Words like 'fringe' and 'marginal,' when applied to the far right, underestimate its centripetal force, its appeal as a lesser evil, the relative freedom with which it is allowed to operate, and the smoke screen it creates." Brilliant @kirstenweld piece: https://t.co/PMNgyuVsrHIn the face of an aggressive assault by the right, the abortion rights movement should abandon its defensive stance and advocate fully integrating abortion into the country’s healthcare system. https://t.co/tYiib8o0yK
